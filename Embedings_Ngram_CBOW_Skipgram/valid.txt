potty training oh yeah , that does n't worry me , it 's going to be so simple . i 'll have him trained before he is two , no problem , i could probably even wing it in a day .

as one parent told me we are not saying that this is an actual danger to the children . what we are saying is that if corners are being cut and proper procedures are not followed , there are some real concerns .

the way i see it is simple . book smart teaches you how to think , but street smart teaches you how to act . take the best of both worlds and be a better self . learn from life too , not just from books .
the same works for a business owner . experiment with a new process or service with a particular customer in mind . the customer will appreciate how you tried , without being asked , to better meet their needs , and you ll become that guy .
for the most part i try not to think about it as i help her balance as we go through our physical therapy exercises . day after day . all the time i 'm thinking that today might just be the day she finally gets it .

i feel that i ca nt keep up with myself . there is so much i want to do , and so much i want to say , but i ca n't seem to find the time to do it . is this an excuse probably .
chicken and pork and the final dish turned delicious . my brother , who 's not usually vocal about food , told me several times that the rice was great . everyone agreed and i was honestly surprised that my first attempt turned out so good .
you know that out of the of us only do mornings well . we tried to go to bed earlier but it did n't work . i only slept from am , i just ca n't sleep when i know i have to get up early .
we do n't give them the freedom expecting that they will choose as we would choose . we give them the freedom so they do n't have to . we give them the freedom because we trust them and want them to grow up trusting themselves .
i m terrified that if people really knew every part of me , i would be completely alone . that at my worst , i m too much for anyone to handle . that maybe i m too much to handle , even at my best .

having worked with this account for years , i was well aware that he can sometimes be set in his ways . if i had any chance of helping him co op his ad i was going to have to show him that sometimes less is more
when it comes to others paths , i learned and hold people to basic rules . if they follow these rules , then everything is good . if they do nt , then well , i guess you could say , we do nt relate well .

my next session of the year was a mini session for baby austin as part of his baby 's first year series of sessions with me . this was his month session , and he had definitely found his hands by then he loved eating his fingers
no matter how old , everyone loves a good story and this sounds like a great opportunity to encourage kids to read some graphic albums as well as novels to me . plus , it 's a great opportunity for all the family to get involved .

i have not kept it a secret that the events of the last couple of years have taken their toll on my emotional well being . i have , however , had a somewhat secret hell that i have created and lived in as a response .
last night i mentioned to dave that i do n't recall getting their invite and he said we probably wo n't because we said we could n't make it . he added they may have thought they could save money by not sending us an invite .
i think this is the first quiet i 've had since friday the first alone moment . i 'll be making the dash to work in a few short minutes , and a busy day will kick into gear but for now i sit in silence .
i am still learning , but i think i am to the point where i can make a consistent extract brew . when i am confident i have it down pat , i will be ready to move on to the challenges of all grain brewing .
thanks so much for stopping by for a visit . i hope you enjoyed my little card and that spring is coming to visit you too thank you , as always , for your sweet comments hugs . . . until next time . . . .
i have never been big on new years resolutions but this year i 've wanted to make a few to hopefully better my life . right now i only have four resolutions and plan to look into anything else that would make me an overall better person .
heart break can come from many places other than romantic love and the best gift we can give ourselves in each case is to let go of the pain when the clock strikes twelve on january st , if not sooner . i 'm going to try .
happy wednesday i ca n't believe another week has passed . i feel like i just finished up my card for last week 's challenge a few minutes ago . time is definitely flying by and i hope that you all are making the most of it .
any large baking pan with a lip on it is perfect for cooking bacon . i use a large bar pan but a jelly roll pan would work fine . if you are cooking less than a pound of bacon you might even use a x pan .
the items in the menu for the dinner were all tried and tasted several times . only one recipe for the main course was tried for the first time by me after viewing it in a local tv channel . i am happy to share it here .
writing is something i feel i must do . it is the only thing i feel i must do . i trust that it is by design of some great positive energy beyond me because , no matter what , i always wind up writing about it .
secondly , i feel like this trailer is made up of people walking into shot , then walking across a room . it makes the whole thing look like a stage play . a really , really boring stage play . for a man that gave us this
take care of your body , as in what you put into it . it 's much harder to lose weight than to gain weight . stay active , view your body as a machine . if you care for it your body will care for you .
i will be starting a new job come the th , and i am also trying to get a part time job for just the summer months . the process is slow , of course , but i already have one interview lined up for next week .
march , one year from the day he proposed to me . i 'm still sad that the proposal was so shocking that i ca n't remember everything he said but i think setting our date on march rd is a sweet way to acknowledge our engagement .
luckily for me , i was nt hurt too bad there were even three people that stopped by to make sure i was okay . because of my weight , i could not stand up so i decided to slide down and wait there for my partner .
just throw whatever you want in here anything you 're trying to use up the last of . i do think that the tomatoes kind of make it , though . i 've been big into roasted slices of tomatoes lately so maybe that 's just me .
and here we are sharing stories with the runner on the ground who could n't exactly get up . marathon tip do n't get on the ground right after the race , unless you plan on staying there for a while . getting up is a challenge .
my second kid 's picks confirm this have books around philosophy . she 's been doing a lot of re reading in the last couple of months . she even told me , lately , i just feel like reading something that i know i 'll love .
also , i can not understand what i am really seeing beyond my own conscious understanding . none of us could and we , as the human , do the only thing we know how to do , relate a new visual to an existing memory understanding .
it has been awesome they love doing their jobs . i have n't had to remind porter to practice his piano . and this morning they were arguing about who was going to take out the garbage for an extra job . never thought that would happen .
i urge you , even if you do n't consider yourself a great artist , sit down and sketch something that inspires you . it could just be a pencil or a piece of wood , it does not have to be as complex as these buildings .
today , and everyday , i remember those who lost their lives on that september morning . i also remember those who have given their lives serving our country . i hold those who are still serving close to my heart and keep them in my prayers .
it s easy to get bored with side dishes because we get tired of eating the same old things , day after day . keep things fun and interesting mix it up so here s a fun new side dish that s healthy , easy , and yummy
perhaps , instead , you have arranged transportation on both ends . if you use a taxi or other service , it probably costs more than the flight . if you have someone take you and pick you up then hopefully they are reliable and on time .
i love the field work visiting places for research . but the library stuff is nt my favourite part of the process . i d rather be getting on with the story , but it s essential , and i often get ideas when i m researching .
i love my dad . now . it took a long time for me to be able to say that and know without a shadow of a doubt that i meant it . i know that sounded horrible but before you judge , allow me to explain .
first , grab the sides of the foil and lift the bar out of the baking dish . place that onto a cutting board . then you can easily pull down the sides of the foil so you can cut the bars , after this next step .
i was born on may , . i have a seven years older big brother . there s a big age difference but we do nt have any problems about it . ever since i was young , we were close , we were even shopping together .
now we are back to school tomorrow and i am going to catch up on all the things that i could n't get done while the kids were off . only more weeks of school and then it 's summer . that 's very hard to believe .
so in order to get away from it all for a few days , she came to our home for a night visit . my dad was left in the good hands of the facility and planned visits from my sister and brother for those several days .
thus , when i got the call the dress was there , i definitely got nervous that it would n't look the way i had remembered and that it would be the wrong size and that i picked the wrong version of the color white for it .
where the hell was this kind of stuff when i was a little kid part of me wants to run out and get all the other vehicles and figures for this line . you know , for the kids . always for the kids , you know .
use your thought power every day for good purposes be a force in the direction of evolution . think each day of some one whom you know to be in sorrow , or suffering , or in need of help and pour out loving thought upon him .
i would like to share some of my tips for having a successful thanksgiving dinner . it is quite a job being the host but there are ways to make it a little easier . yes , this includes everyone having a good time including the cook .
after dropping my son and two friends off at school this sunny wednesday in northern california , i came home to find our of the cats waiting for breakfast at the back door . we now have outdoor cats , are visiting from my daughter s place .
i talk a lot and it comes very naturally to me . my mom told me i was reading well above my reading level from kindergarten and talking much sooner than most children , so it s no surprise to me that this is still the case .
i 'm ready to go . i 'm ready for a break . i 'm ready to sit and breathe . i 'm hoping that this works out and the home is available and that we can make this work . i think we all need it .
an opening reception for the show will be held on saturday , january from pm . the exhibition runs through february . brooklyn artists gym is located on th avenue , rd floor in brooklyn ny . call for more information . hope to see you locals there
us you have tons of passion for wildlife that is great wild animals are known to be difficult subjects to shoot , because they are nt on your schedule . you have to have a ton of patience . what has been one of your most difficult shoots
as if nature did nt present me with a big enough gift surprise with seeing deer in our woods the other day , katie and i were treated to another gift when visiting my mom . she was having a good day . a really good day .
we got there a bit late in the day and some of the buildings were already casting shadows down to the water . so we ended up picking a shorter building that would be easier to measure . we found a nice little historic look out tower .
i started this project convinced that i would write it in english , since i wanted to do more , such as videos , photos and a lot of cool stuff that i would have done if i had had time to actually do it this way .
i will be taking a picture of me in my race outfit so you can be sure to see me i wore it on sunday am , so it s in the wash right now , but i will post a pic in the next few days .
these glasses are all the rage at craft shows in the south this year , and since they run about per glass if you buy them at one , i thought i would show you how simple it is to make one and what a fun gift idea
the trees were in the way so i stepped out of the yard into the wide lawn between the houses to capture some clear shots of the sky . i was only out there a few minutes when i turned around and was met by this sight .
the idea for this mash up video first came to me in the summer of . at the time , i did n't possess the technology and equipment necessary to complete it . so , in a way , this video is a fulfilled dream of sorts .
i always seem to pack my makeup like i pack my clothes . i bring way too much . more than i will ever actually wear . i have to do this though , i need to feel like i have variety and options to pick from .
i did n't even realize that i had n't focused on my number one life stress until the weekend was done and a friend , knowing of my stress , asked me if i 'd gotten what i came for . that 's when it hit me .
and so the phrase stuck with me , you could see them every day , those who hear no music their faces set against a world that they do nt quite understand and if they do n't understand it , it must be changed until they do .
please note i received samples of the above two products from enjoy life foods to help with this review . however , as i mentioned , i 've been a customer of theirs for years . all opinions , thoughts and statements expressed here are our own .
thank you all for reading and i hope you enjoyed this little post about this project i could n't get out of my mind . hats off to the person out there who thought of doing this with a book . you inspired me , whoever you are
she has always been a strange one , said andrew not knowing what to do with himself now . i m andrew by the way . he held out his hand to shake the other s like he would in one of his meetings a formal one .
the constant thread running through my novels was hope . i wanted my readers to know that no matter how bad things get , a new day will come . life will get better even as it is altered from what we might wish it to be .
as long as i 'll be on the phone with the school , i 'm tempted to let them know just how i felt about the registration evening . but i do n't know if i want to establish myself as one of the those moms already .
i 've never spoken about this before , because i am not german and i was n't sure exactly how to phrase things and explain things as a member of the international community of earth , that is was could or can be affected by something german .
i had a lot of issues with the title . nothing seemed right and after putting different styles down , i decided to use a stamp from finishing touch ideas with a ink that went well with the paper . the paint under it really lifted the title .
he kept telling me how special i was and how much he liked to look at me . i kept wondering why he 'd like to look at me so much . he put his hand on my knee while he talked and stared right into my eyes .
our class was split in groups , the ones which have a lower level of french and the ones with the higher one . i was in the higher one , was good i think . that way i was able to take the most out of it .
i did my usual prep work ice in the bars and a cooler full in the trunk water , soda , juice , a couple of newspapers vacuum and clean the windows . start the engine , and note that the gas is showing full . everything normal .
we celebrated my wonderful husband grant 's birthday this week , and of course i wanted to make him a special cake . there were three things i wanted this cake to be light , bright and happy , and it would have a special surprise inside like this
finally , i would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a very happy christmas . thank you all so very much for your visits , comments , support and friendship over the past year . here 's to a blessed and peaceful holiday and a fantastic
the only problem well , i have to finish my driver s ed course first . and a history project that i m doing with a friend . and convince my mom that i m not taking on too much . and find the money . and and and
our boy is happy . that 's what counts . and , he knows his parents are his partners . we 've shown it in action . words are easy , it 's what we do that shows the people we love what we 're really all about .
the criticism is all born out of a little envy of course , and that 's no bad thing really . it 's more satisfying to pick holes in people doing great things rather than admit that they are just better at what you do than you are .
officially , poem in your pocket day is april th , but that does nt mean you can only carry a poem that day . you can print poems from the internet and fold them into pocket sized pieces , or you can buy a small poetry volume .
i wrote this song to capture the fact that we can never be good enough for god . yet god still loves us and gave himself for us . when we accept that gift we can enter into his presence . it is his presence that changes us .
i ca n't mention anything about what the club is doing on sunday i do n't think it 's sorted out yet . i know some of the guys read this and might email me with what they want to do , but as yet nothing is decided .
first , a quick survey for those of you who pop by regularly , sorry there has n't been much new lately . i have n't had time to write much in the line of a book summary in a bit . too much fun and games all summer
an old friend once told me that you search for yourself in your s , you discover yourself in your s , and you define yourself in your s . i 'm looking down the barrel of , and i have n't figured out who i am yet .
well i started my new job on the st . they have crazy training , but i should be finished and able to start actually working the th or the th . but really i would rather have excess training than not enough like at my last job .
i 'm really glad i finally got a chance to do this cookie project it took a long time , from beginning to end , but it was really fun and acted as a great artistic outlet . would n't these be perfect for a birthday party or shower
of course , i 'd be lying if i told you all your stitches are going to look great from day one . unfortunately no one is born knowing exactly how to free motion quilt . everyone goes through a period of very ugly stitches and thread issues .
while i 'm not here to promote drinking , the bottom line is , during the super bowl , there will be a lot of beer being consumed . while beer is never good for your pets , a company as come up with a pet safe beer .
since i 'm in between novels , i 'm taking a break from writing . i 've been doing artwork , like the mini fabric art to the right . it involves tiny scraps of material glued onto mat board . this one is . x . inches .
in summary , if you have enough faith there is no act that you could not perform . that is the more faith , the more extreme the acts can be . that s why i am very afraid of people of faith , having access to weapons .
my photos are rubbish taken with the i phone but no one minded those who brought proper cameras along . i shall spend tomorrow looking to see when he is playing again . this might be big and we were there at the start . that i like .
here is the pic i promised several days ago . i do not photograph well but here it goes anyway . i wish i could send you my fire department id pic instead but it is n't something i have access to other than the id badge itself .
a couple of these i have listed twice because , well , i read them twice this year . and at the time of writing this , there are still three books near the end i have n't finished , but i 'm close enough to list them .
i found this book on a book exchange table years ago at my post office . it contains the old style library check out pocket on the inside cover along with the stamped check out card . i m far more excited to see that than the book .
the course helped me focus on what i wanted to write , and gave me ideas about how . it challenged me to have a go at all sorts of writing , and it gave me a chance to relax and have fun with writing stories as well .
and then sit around and wait for the big day to come there are so many good things and negative things when it comes to moving . what are some things you do to make packing up for a big move less stressful have any of you moved recently
and i have to say that this is one of those lines which seemed so profound to me the first time round , but when i really examine it now and try to tie it in with the story i 'm not at all sure what it means .
her mother took her to the kitchen . she filled three pots with water . in the first , she placed carrots , in the second she placed eggs and the last she placed ground coffee beans . she let them sit and boil without saying a word .
i 'm so grateful to feel a part of this community this group of people who , through large and small acts , accomplish great things . thanks for reminding me of all the awesome in the world on a day when i was reminded of the sad .
i very gently told her that , what she had just done was times worse for her health than , being outdoors where some people were smoking . i also told her that was the reason i could not find acceptable any criticism that she can do about .
during your career , education can often help to take your farther than you would otherwise have gone had you not achieved this level . as the above lists show , there are many options you can pursue to continue your education at any stage of your career .
i also found the square silver one at an estate sale . i want to put one of my paris prints in the small frame , but right now it s resting there until i trim it . both frames have nice detail work which adds some interest .
print these out and attach one to each folder . as your child gets his her school pictures , you can attach a photo to the folder as well using photo corners . we do not have any school photos , so i have not added this yet .
hello and happy tuesday stamping friends hope you all had a fabulous easter celebration i have a quick post for you today . i made a dog sympathy card the other day with one of the newly released stamps over at our daily bread designs called dog sympathy .
how would you like to win tweet of you all you have to do is leave a comment on this post by pm pacific tonight and i 'll draw for one of you to win how does that sound the winners will be announced in tomorrow 's post .
a huge thank you to everyone who participated with us last week and for those who did but did n't quite made it to the deadline to submit their card we always , always appreciate your time and effort grateful that you do share you talent with us .
first she did n't get in the shower with me then the weird smile , i wonder what is going on . i climb into the bed next to her . my dick is nearly hard . but before i can make a move she begins to speak .
every month , you will have a chance to participate in weekly challenges , with each weekly sketch you enter , that will give you an entry in the draw to win our monthly prize . so complete sketch you get entry , complete sketches and you get entries
i was so inspired by the creativity and care you all put into the recipes you submitted to the holiday reader recipe challenge , that i decided to put together a fine selection for everyone to enjoy . it 's your gift to me , back to you .
i hoped they were going to do something and it would stop , she said . but it just carried on . it just started again with different men and more men this time , and that 's when it started becoming up to five men a day .
i think the reason i have nt heard from them is i told them , call me after the bowl . i m really focused on this bowl right now . then i ll talk to my family as far as what we should do and then after that .
but in reality , i had no freaking idea what i was talking about . i threw around the term partner mostly because i wanted to be treated like an adult and i liked the way it sounded , not because it was a true reflection of that relationship .
there is an internet station , which costs a bit of , but i 'm sure i 'll check in a couple of times , but i 'm not taking my own computer . it 's a scary thought to leave my computer behind , but i can do it
eventually after months of my face being naked , i realize i do like the way glasses make me look . as soon , that is , as i m able to replace my ancient wire frames , which runs me about , or more than my first car .
so tell me , by commenting below , where do you stand with your health and what are you goals for just writing them here will put the intention into the universe and place you closer to reaching your goal . i want to help any way i can .
when i do get stuck outside in the rain i like to stay as dry as possible . under the bench is good , under the car better . but the best place is to squeeze down the passage at the side of the house and wait it out .
huge thanks to all of you who joined in with the sketch last week and thanks to everyone who showed interest in our dt call , it 's going to run for one more week , so i 'll start coming round to visit you all during this week .
off to get some rest , i am having some back issues again so think i will take it easy . i had a nice lunch with my mum today and we had some great conversation and a little shopping . the sun was shining and all is good .
i know that baby can hear it i feel him moving around while the music is playing . i also know when he does n't like a particular song , he will send me hard kicks and i know its time to remove that song from the line up .
dear dad , she said . i found you , but i do nt think this is where my life is . although she did nt want to stay with him , a stranger , she could nt wait to give him the letters that remained in her notebook .
all in all , i d say it was a pretty successful night . we had a huge paint war and i was so grateful for all the support and people that showed up to make it so awesome . it just proves that you really can accomplish anything .
it was in this conversation that i mentioned my own concept . the conversation heated about my dislike for polish people at the time and how i think i d never finish the book because i am stubborn about seeing the world and recording new findings all the time .
if this interpretation is too liberal , know that it is not necessary to agree with this one point in order to see christ in creation . there are other places which have more obvious references to christ in genesis . the first one which comes to mind is genesis
in the end , i chose classical greek only to discover that i , in a typically unique fashion , had been the only person in my year to choose it , and so they could nt run the course . it looked like i was stuck with art .
i also bought myself a little something . this something is something that i have been thinking about ever since i saw it a week ago . i even talked about it at thanksgiving dinner , which told me i needed to go back and buy it for myself .
i was thinking that since i have been very good with my money this pay period i may try and find a sports bar to go and watch the game . but since i fell asleep a while ago i am a little late for that now i guess .
it s been a mild winter here so far i told hubby that it was the lord being kind to us and breaking us in to the cold slowly i still do nt go out a lot , but i will admit that it could have been much much worse
a great event with something for everyone this sunday in crown heights from seeds in the middle . if you 're a restaurant food service owner or otherwise work in the industry , they 're still looking for donations to feed the kids , and every little bit helps .
just a reminder that my teachers pay teachers store will be having a sale starting tomorrow in honor of teacher appreciation week from may th everything will be off . be sure to check out my new hawaii unit . we had so much fun using it in our classroom
did nt god say , the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord do nt you believe what god has said the lord does nt make any mistakes . we certainly do . do we dare to complain when those steps are nt according to our preparation
when a mother asks us in front of her daughter if we know the tooth fairy we tell her we sure do that we had tea with her just yesterday and the mom turns to the daughter and says , see i told you the tooth fairy was a she
try to get your ex to meet you in a non romantic setting . like for a game , or to a place where you are meeting your common friends . this way , none of you feels uncomfortable with the situation and you have fun with each other .
so then , the most important thing that we were told to do as followers of christ is not to share the gospel , but to love our god with all our hearts , and to love our neighbor . he says that the second is like the first .
anyway , here 's a little project i did yesterday . i plan on doing a whole white and black section of halloween decor in my house . sorry i did n't take pictures of before . but it 's very simple , so no pictures are really needed .
. get into the word make it your life study to know god and his ways and his will and learn to hear his voice become a person after his heart like david get into the word and learn the promises of god this is what you will live by
i looked over at him . he stood there smiling waiting for me to ask my inner self the question . so i did . i asked what topic my audience needed to hear . i stood there quietly waiting for a miracle to occur . i got nothing .
. friends these are the people you re friends with , but do nt go out of your way to hang out with all the time . someone brings them up in conversation and it s oh , yeah i m friends with them but not much more than that
here are the kids at my parents house easter morning . we go to their house bright and early for a big breakfast and egg hunt with my sisters kids . i am not a breakfast person but every easter i look forward to the great breakfast they have .
it might also be because my mind is board dave gets frustrated with me sometimes because i always have to be planning things and changing things . i always have him helping me set stuff up or asking his opinions on stuff . i blame it on my mom .
i think this highlights a couple of standard liberal beliefs about education and actions the first being that all beliefs are somehow equal and worthy of similar respect , and the second is that every action is a reaction . we 're all victims , just in different ways .
this is the kind of organization that the sport needs here in the us leadership from those who bear the ultimate responsibility for performance . if we are not getting the leadership necessary from the head office we can still effect change if we get some leadership from middle management
i write . i write poems and descriptions of all sorts . i write letters and prayers . the more i write , the more i know how much words have always meant to me . written words came and come easily , always , and i treasure them .
in keeping with the new age we live in , i planned this year s trip by text . and without fail , after the date was agreed upon yesterday , i got texts from all my girls saying things like i ca nt wait i miss you love you
max is going for his grade assessment at st david 's next week tuesday which i am really upset to missing . i ca n't believe he is going to big school next year . here is a picture of max the night before i came to new york .
well , not everyone 's lives are nice and perfect and tied with a bow . not mine certainly i 'm all for setting goals and making plans to reach those goals . but when do you do when life not excuses , gets in the way of those plans
i encourage you to listen in on one of the opportunity chat phone calls listed on the page . you 'll learn the facts that you need to know about the business like how much can i earn , how much time does it take how do i get started
of a local gardening store . normally i would n't but something , i would make it myself , but for i thought i could use it to get a good idea of how to make my own . which i will , very soon and then share with you
having more homework than hours in the day , but somehow getting it finished on time . and even getting good scores that 's a miracle if i 've ever seen one , but i would n't have experienced it if i had n't had a ridiculous amount homework .
i have learned how to be content with whatever i have . i know how to live on almost nothing or with everything . i have learned the secret of living in every situation , whether it is with a full stomach or empty , with plenty or little .
this week is n't looking like i 'll get much done throughout the week . but hopefully i 'll have some time next weekend to work on some of my items . like my rd grade common core math review pack to match the k and nd grade ones .
wow , is what i have to say about what happened today . i 'm going to share another very personal experience , because this is my life and it 's who i am . i 'm an open book with nothing to hide and this is important to me .
i remember how we would let the days slip by us as though they would go on and on forever , about how life seemed like an endless road we could wander down , not looking back , not looking forward , just dancing our days away down that road .
sorry i have been a little quiet but not been feeling good all week . i am sure i caught what the kids had but their bugs usually effects us in a bad way . and not been feeling up to crafting much . been going to bed at pm .
any usage of the hand is painful . i am often dropping objects if i try to hold them in the right hand . it s embarrassing . i ca nt eat . cutting meat and using a fork present a challenge and i am often quite embarrassed in public .
one good way to shift those feelings and get yourself back to a place where you can begin to work on the actual actions you need to take to change something in your life , is by getting physical . call it exercise , call it movement . . . more
enjoy one of these songs and have your own cool feeling . or share one of your own what song gives you that ' cool feeling ' it put a smile on my face just posting these here 's to a good last week of february and a much anticipated march

they look so yummy in that picture i had them for lunch today and they were quite delicious . i brought two with me and could only get through one and a half before i had to stop . below are the ingredients and the process for making these yummy things
today i am going to share with you all an amazingly easy project that i first learned about in my moms club in florida . these are some of the most creative and awesome ladies ever , and i am so excited to share this i spy book with you .
so , i grab my coffee and the car keys and make the quick trip over to her place . i pull into the driveway and am thankful there 's no one else 's car there but hers . and , then i pray . for her , for me .
i have a meeting with a publisher at a conference at the end of the month . i will be presenting them several chapters and a proposal . do you have any recommendations on how i should present it to them bound , in a folder , loose , etc .
i just printed out a copy onto cardstock for each folder , for each year and popped them inside . doing this ahead of time will ensure a consistent look for all years down the line , and make it easier to keep up as the years come and go .
so , be inspired by the photo in anyway it inspired you . since this is an inspiration challenge , projects do need to demonstrate that they are indeed inspired by the photo . you can go to paper cupcakes and see my team mates creation . thanks in advance .
well , there are plenty of reasons that i run . i run so that i can eat . i run because i can listen to music when i run , and i do love music . i run because i love talking with my best friend while we run .
it seems impossible that i am sick when the sun is shining . that anything could be wrong on a day like this is hard to believe , and i do find it more difficult to take my illness seriously when the weather calls for ice cream and beer gardens .
i am not saying that the images then were better than now , but that they have changed quite a bit over time . i think that technically , i could do this again , but i am not sure i 'd have the mind set for it right now .
of course , it is sometimes difficult to get candidates all together on the same night but i understand that , if candidates could not attend , they had the option of sending along a representative to speak on their behalf . sadly , that offer was not taken up .
today is a day of realization i do not like what i have become nor am i willing to accept it . today is a new beginning and no matter what , life has to change now . no more excuses , no more reasons , no more no more .
next , we have the games away from home . that s when you get to see the band perform . that is , you move to the other side during the half time show and then return to the home side to discover that your seat has been taken .
to follow jesus way , you do nt just follow a plan or a path , you follow a person . you follow jesus himself . you come to know him faith . then , you learn from him by reading the bible and letting the holy spirit guide you .
i planned to sit at my desk , but the glow from the outside light hit the stairs like an actor 's spotlight . i sat down in the middle of the stairs , opened my notebook , and like the star on the stage , i began to create .

mobile journalism to me means giving the world the most up to the minute information on what s going on . whether your covering a news story , at a baseball game or even a breaking news event happening in your eyes . it s a great thing to share .

secondly , i was able to see the forest in terms of what it 's potential is or was , rather than what currently exists . above is a small section of cut forest . maybe nothing shocking , but definitely devastating to what used to grow and live there .
i ca nt believe that training is almost over . there are so many things i ll miss about training , yet i m getting excited for race day and for my parents to be there to support me and cheer me on for my first . . two more weeks

the conference bridge automatically sends me an email at the end of every conference call across the company , listing the total minutes , the number of participants and the number they called in from . so when i got this e mail i had to stare at it for a minute
maybe i m just tired overall and i m pushing have pushed myself a bit too far lately . i felt like i had wings and flew a bit too close to the sun . i m still here writing , so clearly i did nt completely burn my wings off .
also , the ending of the novel which should explain the reasons for what characters go through just did nt explain anything , in my opinion . i truly did nt understand why peter and the others had to do what they did , since there s no explanation for it .

some of you have made it very clear that the suspense is killing you , so for that reason , i finally took some photos . the photos had much more to do with getting to put my fall decor out that i just cleaned house but that 's beside the point
we discovered later that european credit cards have some kind of computer chip in them that american cards do n't have . this was n't a problem anywhere but in the train station . but at the time , this was just one more worry would our cards work nowhere in france
arriving in london on monday , after eight full days of swimming which captured the hearts and imagination of the public , he inspired us all and lifted our spirits what a fantastic effort he raised over one million pounds for the charity , about which he is clearly very passionate .
ask about camp , and you 'll hear so many stories of fun , and learning , and growth , and healing , and inside jokes , and new talents , and old friends , you 'll really wish that you had been there with me , just to experience that .
i had this moment that i realized despite what was happening to this man in front of me , i d been more concerned with the composition of my photo shot than i was with any attempt to either save him or at the very , very least ease his passing .
i love how she kind of knows santa is not real but that she wants to still believe so she can have a little fun at christmas . it 's the perfect combination of christmas tradition , i think . with a lot about christ and a little fun with santa .
there were several reasons , i think , that i hated reading . it was hard to admit some of the reasons to myself . but i love all of you guys and feel like we re friends . so i wanna let you guys know what s been going on .
in light of some of noah s recent behavior changes and the fact that he can sit and eat in a restaurant now which is something he could nt have done a couple of years ago we decided to attempt bringing him to the christmas eve service with all of us .
just came back from france . we decided to go home one week earlier because of the bad weather . in one week we had one day of sun , and all the other days were filled with rain , wind and cold , so unfortunately not so much pictures to show
i truly believe that i once saw a ghost in our home in dallas , texas , after i had gone to bed one night . she was non threatening and produced feelings of awe rather than fear . however , i never slept on that side of the bed again .
i want to hug her at the most random times , see her smile because i made a silly joke . walk hand in hand with her while we go places , and laugh at stupid dumb things . look into her eyes and see the passionate fire in her eyes .
you may have a personal injury case if you or a loved one is injured or killed . it is important to call a lawyer if you think you might have a claim . that lawyer will honestly discuss your potential claim and help you determine if you have a case .
oliver has started a sunday school program at our church for year olds , where parents are alongside their kids singing songs , listening to a story , doing crafts , and of course , learning about jesus . last week , the craft was making angels out of construction paper .
i know that i m allowing fear to take over and rule my thoughts and emotions right now . but i have to be honest with what s going on in my head and my heart right now , otherwise i m going to be completely overwhelmed with all of it .
good morning happy friday i 'm looking forward to a relaxing weekend in fact , the only plans we have are for a trip to target one of my favorite places and i might even sneak in a massage appointment and finally use the gift certificate that jon gave me for christmas
these are things that have not yet been used and are , in fact , still in their original box while their fate is decided . several of them turned out be very useful closer to the six month stage , so they are things you can delay purchasing until then .
it may happen that someday everything else will be gone and i will be old and alone . all i will have is myself , and i want to be able to live with myself . in some way , there is always a part of me preparing for that time .
lately , i have given a lot of thought as to what a blessing my family is . i really do love them so very much . my greatest wish is for my family for them to grow a little closer to god every day and grow more christ like daily .
in general , i ride my bicycle everywhere i go , and if i m hanging out with friends then they drive . but i do not often take the light rail . today i did . and on my way back from the movie , i was handed a magazine .
but should i do that i mean , i have been put under fire by someone that does not matter to me , but i wonder if she is nt just expressing some of the thoughts a lot of people around me are thinking , but do not say it aloud .
i do n't know a whole lot of nice , christian boys . in fact , i have do n't know that many guys . there are a couple of them in our home school group completely different group from the meeting one that i know , but not that well .
i am at the point where i can admit i have a problem , but well beyond the point of helping myself . i have no idea where i fall in the intervention scale , but i m pretty sure i need one . especially because of what happened this weekend .
my opinion of apple has taken a very significant dive . it seems that when you get beneath the surface they are no different from the rest of the tech industry . all they want to do is sell you something . once they do , you can go screw yourself .
i do nt feel as though i wasted my life watching this film , so why not go for it . it s not hilarious . but it s not boring either . in fact , i would argue that the acting was above average by comparison to most ordinary relationship films .
the final boo however must go to the arsenal team who , apart from mins in the second half played as if they were asleep . that s being kind . many are saying they played as if they simply did nt care , and i do nt want to think that .
i do ask god first , with regard to my dreams and my plans , if this is not your will , could you please show me how you want my resources and life used , because i am totally open , as i know your plans are so much better than mine
i once got a bag of fancy scrapbook paper scraps and had students choose and glue them into the background and then continue the design in colored pencil . i liked this method because it brought color into the work and reduced the amount of background drawing the kids needed to to .
this conversation took many years , by the end of which time the old earth priest was very tired and hungry and returned to the temple and wrote the words of the old warrior stone in a book on such matters which can be found in the temple library to this day .
they could have said , the lord s going to save us . let s just sit back and see how he does it . i was discussing medical insurance with a fellow believer and this reply came to me . i do nt have any insurance i just trust the lord .

after ten plus seasons of spring ball between both kids , with absolutely amazing , generous coaches , i know that the coaches do it for the love of the game and the love of their kids and the joy of seeing other people s kids work hard to reach their potential .
having considered the above request i am unable to provide much of the information that you require as it is not physically recorded and therefore does not fall under the scope of the act . however in order to provide some explanation you may find the information below to be of interest .
so take things slowly , and let him know that if he needs to take a break because his mind is wandering , it 's okay for him to tell you that . you 'd rather he be honest so that he can get his heart and head right and start again .
if you re looking to become a more social media minded company , it s not just about figuring out what sites you want you to develop a presence on . it s about understanding how to make your brand social from the inside out and putting the right procedures in place .
besides the teachers , there are also other people living up in the fort and they have children of all ages , of course . we saw them walking down , or riding their bikes or taking their bus down to school , or going places , playing or just passing by .
we 're trying to enjoy our time with him and he is loving all the extra attention . l and i are both a mess i am losing it just typing this out , but trying to stay normal . his quality of life right now is good and he 's happy .
we think that when a guy says he s going to leave his girlfriend wife for us , we believe them . we think he ll come to his senses and realize what he s missing and naturally come back to us and love us like we re supposed to be loved .
however , such a statement is valid if we believe in the independent reality of the mind , body and world . it draws attention to the fact that every experience of the mind , body and world is utterly one with awareness or presence . it is a half way stage .
halloween is the best holiday for children . they cut school , dress up and are allowed to have all the candy they want for just this day . parents also like this holiday as children can enjoy their time without having to organize a party or other expensive event for them .
when you get older you may begin to feel like your memory is losing some of its ability to store as much information as it used to . although this is normal there are steps techniques and even exercises you can do to reduce this effect and may actually improve your memory .
the answer in the street is always no . can i ask you something no . do you have a cigarette no . can you tell me what time it is no . the answer is always no . do n't be nice . stop the encounter as soon as it starts .
so that is what i have planned to start off with for the summer with my kids . they start out each day with a school work assignment and some household chores before they head outside to enjoy the sunshine . helps them transition back into school a little easier in august too
. poverty when i was really small , whenever my parents gave me good food i d think that something bad was coming up , like we would run out of money very soon cause i always heard them discussing about money so i was really scared . not anymore i guess .
i ll have a schedule . i can now be late for work . i will most likely be late for work . i have to speak to human beings , actual people , face to face . i should probably wear makeup . i should probably learn how to wear makeup .
thank you to all those who came to visit me your visits and words are very much appreciated and keep me going . also , thanks to anyone who became a follower as a result i love to see a new face in my followers box , so thank you and welcome .
we gathered as a family last weekend to celebrate my father s th birthday . as you can see the grandchildren were more interested in technology than conversation . yet this scene is becoming more typical when children and adults gather together , and i m usually in the thick of it .
i am happy to say that i just got an email from the canadian scrapbook magazine and they want this page to publish in their magazine with the letter i was asked to remove it from all online sites so that is why there is no picture of the layout here now .
i still give my husband a hard time about that , wishing he would have at least recommended i put on a pair of jeans or brush my hair or teeth . but it was sweet of them to give me a party so i could n't be too upset about it .
sometimes just getting out of bed is a struggle and writing is rough , but with my scattered thinking and other issues , it is about all i can do now . that 's the long answer . the short answer is , i do n't know . i 'm a writer .
but one thing that came out is that no one won , that s boring and i really hate that , when u watch a game , u expect one team to win , but in this term , both teams were winners because it was a draw when the game ended .
first there was to much stress related to the holidays baking , christmas related stuff , etc , then came our holiday at the in laws in germany for one week . i spent the end of the last year and start of the new year in bed with a mean cold .
i ll be honest . i wanted to tell him about it . i felt so sad for him not to be included . but it was nt mine to do the inviting . and , i knew i had to just let things be . which is not easy for me .
today my neighbor gave me another root . it 's a whole different animal . no branches to sort through . i 'll have to spend some time turning it over and around and looking at it . but first i had to give it a good washing with a stiff brush .
i am absolutely amazed at the support shown in the last post . it proves , yet again , what a close and caring community we have here . i wish i could give you a hug , or shake your hand , but all i can do is say thank you .
i flew to las vegas to meet my husband for a couple of days before christmas . we had a quick , fun , child free mini vacation and returned home for a lovely christmas eve family celebration . one of the places i wanted to see while in vegas was this shop
when i went to college someone told me do n't eat the pizza . she told me this because when she went to college she gained a lot of weight , and it was because she and her friends ate pizza all the time . so i never ate pizza in college .
then one day , she handed me a piece of paper with her name written perfectly . she just figured it out . without asking , without anyone telling her . just based on seeing her name written in other places , and making the connection between that and her own writing .
enjoy it , dear friend . all of it . tomorrow it will be different , and different the day after that . it is all meant to be enjoyed , learned from and taken in as a gift . receive it with all of the love it was intended to give .
another approach this dad could have taken was to give his son the choice of getting dressed at home or taking his clothes in a bag and getting dressed at school . allowing our children to accomplish their own tasks in their own way is a gift which will help them grow .
the most difficult for us i think was that we did nt know each other well enough to understand each others actions at the time . like now without us speaking , we can both understand what the other one is feeling . we can look more into it without even talking .
f is for flash fiction short stories under , words . some flash fiction regulations allow for more than that , but personally i think even , words is too long . i love writing stories in just a paragraph , or just a hundred words , or with a sentence limit .
we work hard to find and deliver to you the latest in stamping and paper crafting supplies attending classes , workshops , and sales meetings around the world , our goal is to keep our product offerings fresh and current . make us your one stop easy shop and we 'll deliver right to
i 'll never forget the day it all came out . i had n't seen him much for the last few days and he asked to meet up after work . he was sat with a pint when i arrived and jumped up to get me one as soon as i came in .
i have been sitting in this question the last few days as i let go of soul contracts that no longer work for me . even though i do nt know exactly what this looks like , i trusted my guides to work with me , and through me , on this matter .
there is never a time when you are with god that you do not benefit from being in his presence . every time you are with god , you will undoubtedly benefit . god has perfect timing never early and never late and it takes a little patience and a lot of faith .
i wanted to take a moment to share a praise with you . not only have i been so blessed by many of you who have greeted me and welcomed me back to work after my surgery , but i have had the opportunity to share more of god 's story with you .
after that you may have to change your ideas or the way your story is told and do n't mistake a shorter book or a picture book for being one that is easier to write . usually the fewer words there are , the harder you have to work to get it right .
i did manage to do everything on yesterday 's list with the exception of find title for car , but i 'm pretty sure i know where it is , and i wrote words i had to leave to pick the boy up from school , so all in all not too bad .
i was , and i imagined i must have been beautiful then . they were older than i was , strong handsome men with girl friends . i remember calling my best friend then to ask her if i should go ahead with it . and she said , go just try it out
but now let 's get back to the fish at the top of this post . i did n't really make any resolutions per se this year , but i did decide i should try to cook and eat more fish . so good for you so tasty so many different fish to try
but no one was there for me just this man listening to my call for help and ok of course he s a man and he was waiting for something else but he did nt make me feel like this and i am sure he knew that we would never meet up again .
yes , i 'm really not surprised . for some time now , i have to remember to put my camera beyond his reach whenever i put it down . too many times , i 've looked over and seen him walking around with my d , trying to figure out the buttons .
and , making a list of the things she can do is n't what i need to know . you 've already told me she 's magic . i assume she can do all sorts of cool stuff . the question is what does she want and what 's keeping her from it .
the tech made it before pm and my phone works again . like somebody who made a promise to god in order to get out of a jam and survived i do nt feel much like keeping my promise to get a cell phone . but really it is time , or is it
several of my friends have been there and have only spoken good words about it . i ca nt wait until i get to see it myself . it s highly likely that i ll combine my japan trip with this one to save time and money . but more on that later on
writing is drawing the essence of what we know out of the shadows . that is what writing is about . not what happens there , not what actions are played out there , but the there itself . there , that is writing 's location and aim . but how to get there
i really do nt want to . i wanted and thought we would do this together as friends , as we have discussed this before and she was in agreement it would be for the best to live together , until one of us needs to move on after i go full time .
sadly , there s not a lot out there for them besides a few adult women in their lives that they can turn to in need , there is almost nothing in mainstream society that speaks to young women about their growth and desires in sex positive , yet realistic and honest ways .
i love to use rocks to teach the five senses . i know that you 're probably thinking , you can only teach senses with rocks . you ca n't taste them if that 's what your thinking then you 're wrong i 'll get to the taste part later in this post .
i m nobody s fool i know trouble when i see it and i can generally figure my way around it . mama says i m a lot like her , but there s one difference when daddy gets ugly , she eggs him on , me , i just up and disappear .
this only happens twice a year and only when i need to raise funds for my work with these families . all of you long time clients out there know that this kind of special does n't come along very often , so be sure to book early before the available dates are gone
we had a christmas eve celebration with my family on the day before christmas eve because that worked out best for everyone . the evening was later than usual so we did nt get everything done that we usually like to . however , it was great just spending time with each other .
we are not connected to a place . by that , i mean we do n't have to be in a certain physical location to take part in things like watching movies , listening to music , etc . we can do it anywhere and with almost any device assuming it is electronic .
i really enjoyed this run . i hope we can plan to make this happen at least once or twice a week . if i keep at it , i will surely get used to the early morning wake up , right how do you early birds do it any suggestions would be great
last night it was concerning breaks . now , looking at colorado labor laws which have changed since the last time i looked at them , he 's within his rights to limit smoke breaks to five minutes every two hours , considering the break requirement is ten minutes every four . however .
. preheat oven to degrees . roll out the pizza dough to the size of a sheet of paper . spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough . if you do too much the sauce will make a mess when you roll and cut it , trust me i know .
i hate to disappoint him , but usually after a trip away , even a short one , his favourite game is a bit like spot the difference . as in , how many new or ' new ' old things has amanda been able to sneak into the house during his absence .
i would consider series ideas but i d need to be convinced by the writing as well as the concept . series are a big commitment i think if you are a debut author starting with this is choosing a more difficult path . please note , i did nt take my own advice
he declared , we 're very excited to take brooklyn and bring it to countries around the world . we could n't be more excited about the jay z inspired and designed black and white logo , which we think is going to be a huge hit in markets all around the world .
my hair is about white . no , not grey , white . i dye it red . getting white hair early runs in the family my mom and grandma both had completely white hair before they were out of high school . mine did n't start ' til i married the ex .
today is going to be a mixed bag of topics , since i 've covered a lot of the major ideas already . with this post i 'm going to get into some more abstract ideas such as texture and theme , as well as a discussion of how to define your waist .
it s harder to get there now , but i do nt know why they want to prevent us from going there as it is beautiful and even has an own chat channel . hopefully they will fully develop the zone and put it to use in the game as they first intended .
i do n't know how i 'm going to get through all these questions , so i 'll keep my responses really short i 'll be back hopefully tonight to answer the them , but i 'll probably have to spread it out over a couple days because that would be one long post
the agent was focused on the case , unlike the others , and he stood out from the others from the rest of the people in town he just did not fit in with in d , but he did not seem to care , and his focus was on solving the case .
the back is a plain fabric and i m using strips of the same to edge it . it s a floor quilt . basically something they can chuck on the carpet or sofa for him or her to lie on . i hope they like it , my fingers may never recover .
yet , despite , all her words about wanting to keep them , i was sure she wanted to sell . for the first time she let me talk i smiled , your fabrics are stunning , i have quite a collection at home , but i have n't often seen any this beautiful
i am thankful for so many things this year . way too many to list while i have a turkey to bake i hope everyone well , i guess only my american friends has a wonderful thanksgiving . and to those not celebrating , i hope you have a wonderful day as well .
to increase the challenge , i sometimes use a word strip with a phrase , a scripture , or a question that matches each item in the display . i put these word strips in a can or basket to draw from and , after the match is made , we sing the song .
maybe i should join a critique group . but the one time i did that , i was so shy that not only i could n't read my book out loud , but i did not dare give my opinion to anyone either . i went once and came home feeling miserable and embarrassed .
bad stuff nothing . some people might claim it s not realistic , but they re missing the whole point of watching an entertaining movie . this is nt a documentary , it s an action comedy flick based on an action comedy tv show did anyone really think the tv show was ever realistic
in high school i thought i wanted to be an attorney , i wanted to put bad guys in jail . dead set on it in fact . my first year in college i realized i did n't have the personality to be an attorney . i 'm just not that type of person .
i will remember cooking meals in our little cottage , and sitting around the table with my family enjoying a early dinner . i will remember sending my children off to bed early , warm and clean after a deep bath , ready for another day of running in the sand and the sea .
january st is sarah 's grandparents ' wedding anniversary . they thought it 'd be a nice tribute to have the same wedding day since they are still married after more than fifty years . they wanted to keep things relatively low key , so they only invited a selected group of close friends .
oh and if you do n't know me very well yet , than you might not know about my crazy obsession with christmas music . i start listening to it in october every year . but , i love it and i buy almost every album that ever comes out . including this one .
it occurred to me that i have n't done one of those giant trade posts that everyone loves so much in quite awhile . it also occurred to me that i am on vacation this week . why on earth have i not realized that vacation is the perfect time for a giant trade post
i am almost and my wife is not well . being able to order and pay for everything we have delivered , which is almost everything we buy , the cash back pays the delivery tips , which is a great help to us with so many dr . bills and other necessary items .
it is so simple , that for some , it is difficult to understand . it is this the kingdom of god is inside you and outside of you . please relax your minds so you can hear . the same kingdom of god that jesus told you about is both within and without .
fourth , if you are buying a regular vehicle ask for a deal . it s ok , we re not like the grocery store ask for a discount there sometime but do keep in mind that we need to make a little money to support our families and to keep the lights on .
calories in must be less than calories out . if you are trying to lose weight does n't matter how you do it , this simple rule applies across the board do you know how many calories you consume vs use in a day find out . i believe knowledge is power with this one
a totally quirky read i kept saying to myself how strange the story was and how i did n't have any idea what was going on , but it did n't matter . i wanted to keep reading and reading and i was determined to figure out what was truly happening in little hope .
merry christmas to all of you who celebrate it . happy holiday to everyone who celebrate another holiday this time of year . no matter what you call your holiday , i wish you peace , happiness with your family and friends . lot 's of good food without any calories see you next year
it 's not really possible to live as if school does n't exist , because so many depend on it existing and do not question the order of things . and you know , a lot of days that whole business is tricky enough without the pressure of why why why , explain yourself .
every time that we go to chicago , we always get a picture of the building with the clock . there is a bridge you can cross and we take the picture with that building in the background . for some reason , i tried several different pictures and they all came out dark .
may i say this concerning those who want a voice or the like they have no faith . they do not believe . they want to walk by sight , not by faith which is absolutely contrary to the will of god in corinthians . for we walk by faith , not by sight .
i think i would tell myself not to be so sensitive to what other people think and say . i would be more in touch with myself and my own feelings and self worth . listen to criticism , take it at face value and either accept it , use it or reject it .
last night we came up to the lake to spend mother 's day morning with my mother in law as we usually do i ca n't believe hubby has the day off and later in the day after lunch we will head down towards home and have dinner with my grandma and step mom .
i stared right back into her eyes and said you might be her mother but that does not give you the right to beat on her like that , i do n't care how old she is or how drunk you are , it does not give you the right to abuse her like that
that word made a very important part of my life . almost . i was almost happy . i almost had everything i wanted . i was almost successful . but never altogether . never completely . and i never knew how to fix that thing . and moreover , i never ever tried .
anyway , it will be good to see my old friends again , i 'm sorry , as i have n't seen some of them for nearly a year and we only live miles away from each other . ridiculous , i know , but time just seems to disappear when you get old .
as always , if you do n't have a certain shape , feel free to substitute . for my original card i used a heart shape , but for this week 's sample i went with a circle . the most important thing is to make the sketch work for you and to have fun
then i spread my room temperature jam over the first layer . the jam did nt go very far i would probably increase the amount of jam by half if i were to make this one again . it then returned to the oven for about minutes . it was starting to brown up nicely
i am so glad i got this done . i hope some of you can use this . just a reminder that i have a chance for you to get free april math centers on my previous post . make sure to check back on thursday because there might be a little surprise for everyone
the american diet is so far removed from the natural state of food that most of us have no idea where what we eat comes from . even our lettuce comes processed when i was a child , i had to tear apart a head of lettuce if i wanted to have a salad .
out of girls , just one did n't earn any while my original thought was that half the girls might earn some and that might inspire the other half , since it was just one girl i did give her a general badge instead , as i did n't want to single her out .
for example i m on a row doing something but i know if i continue in this path it s going to lead to failure . i am not afraid to fail . i keep doing it . then i fail . i stress out about it for or days then i m over it .

even though the go between has been up for about years , i 've never walked or run across it . today was the day . it only adds about m to the length of the run , but i figure now i 've done this i can run more along the other side of the river .
so , here are some of my thoughts , albeit most suited to writers of non fiction , as i do not write fiction . most agents represent a mixture of fiction and non fiction , children s and young adult material . read their list carefully and do nt submit any genres they do nt handle .

i started studying german again last fall , but it 's just been in the past few months that i have really kicked it into high gear . i 've always heard that if you know a second language , learning a third is easier . i 'm not buying it . learning german is hard work .
we fight so we can get better at it . what the reason is , i do nt know . but i feel that rush each time we re against another team . every time they come at us , every time i swing that damn hammer . i like it . i think you do too .

i think this tune was fairly easy to play and i m mostly happy with how i played it . however , on listening to the recording i noticed the guitar playing almost the same as the piano . in the original recording there is no guitar part so technically it was correct to play what i played .

when i stopped my day care i had some health problem and was getting very stressed too . i felt like all i was doing all day was saying do nt touch this , do go there , do nt do that . having a place only for children would cut the do nt from half at least .

i feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders right now . between my dad and grandma i 'm worried and scared . it 's hard to focus on other things but i have to . it 's been really hard on me but i 'll get through . it 's a part of life .
today 's book tour stop is a review . there are so many people reading a story of the west who say they do n't normally read books set during this time period s american west , but who really like my book . i say , if it 's a good story , the setting becomes secondary .
paul being the determined person that he is has spent the past half hour fishing , it is absolutely freezing out there so i think he is mad over the last couple of days he has caught one fish . words really do fail me but if it keeps an old man happy who am i to comment ..

we have a small piece of land to live on and they have fields that go beyond our sight . we have servants who serve us , but they serve others . we buy our food , but they grow theirs . we have walls around our property to protect us , they have friends to protect them .

project i did pretty good with this last year . i really enjoyed looking back at all the pictures when i put together the year review slide show so i 'm definitely continuing this this year . the difference will be that i 'm going to move it to the weekend and expanding it into a week in review .
i am so tired . i am tired physically , mentally , emotionally , spiritually . i feel like i am dying . i m tired of trying to sort out my life . i m tired of hurting . and of crying . i m tired of dealing with this . i m tired of writing about it .
maybe my own confusion goes back to my first paragraph . i would be the mom . just the mom what about the rest of me is that all i would be is being only a mom enough is there something wrong , even selfish about me if i am more than a mom my head is spinning already .
tonight i made another yummy meal and i believe my husband liked it . i still wish he would begin cooking again , or even shopping for groceries for that matter . but you ca nt have everything . and i knew a good thing when it was going on all these years , so at least there s that
the growing wave of women of color , especially black women , making the switch to natural hair seems to cause some confusion , because of all the info that is out there . i plan to give you some general guides and my two cents as i stated earlier . i hope this will be helpful to somebody .

in the dream , he appeared out of nowhere and started talking to me . we were in line at a concert , which was typically where we were throughout our relationship and subsequent friendship . i do nt remember much else , just that we were talking . it was awkward , but nice at the same time .
i am attempting to do a better job about why we pray a certain way , do certain things at mass , etc . for instance , our daughter is pretty good at learning the prayers and that is the first step , but i realized recently that she may not really understand some of the words or ideas .
the only thing they did n't know , and the question that i was supposed to have the answer to , was what i wanted to be . there was n't much discussion of my potential , because as far as they knew , i was living up to it at the time and would continue to do so .
you can see that the pink is far too dark here but this was just a test . i will be going over the top edge with the paper mix to get a nice finish but this box has n't been cut yet hence the funny angle . i hope to do a couple with music print paper too .
it s surprising how different my routine has gotten . i did nt know what day of the week it was today . it only took a week for me to lose track of that kind of time . on the other hand , i can tell the time by the position of the sun now within an hour .

what this tells you is that , while the light does nt reflect back towards the camera off of the air , when the light passes through the air it gets bent . in other words the air acts like a weak lens . maybe the thing to do is shine the light through the air towards the camera .
i 'm glad that the shower is over though . i totally hate being the center of attention and hosting it at my house was stressful but it turned out perfectly . everyone loved seeing his room and a lot of my family has never been to my house so they were all happy to see my house too .

i apologize . andrew and i ate it all before i could get a decent shot of it . it was ridiculously good . it was this chocolate cake , in case you were wondering . i topped it with cream cheese frosting . i have no doubt i ll make it again . it was just that good .

here is a quick birthday card i made with the narrow foam tape . i wanted to hide the border on the lace with a strip of paper , but i did n't want to use a really wide piece of paper . the foam tape was perfect for hiding the lace and glue used to hold down the lace .

well , i 'm a little confused . you see , i wrote the person handling our case at the agency month ago asking if everything was in , and she said yes . i specifically asked her this question because we never received any of the copies of our state or federal clearances for me to keep track with .

they are pretty pleased with the result and i think it looks pretty cute . we all had a hand in it somewhere , even the man of the house painted the sky because little people 's arms could not reach that high . i wonder what a real estate agent will say about it if we ever decide to sell

each woman faces her own unique challenges and struggles during pregnancy . the hardest part about pregnancy for me is gaining weight . i have worked so hard to get rid of the extra weight on my body . not only have i made it to my goal weight , but i was able to maintain it for over years .
in the museum was a restaurant which took street kids in and taught them how to cook and gave them the skills needed to help themselves , the food we ate was nice not up to chinese standard yet but it felt good to be paying a little more and being able to help these kids in a positive way .
nine copies sold between the three of us . we all felt like we got our money 's worth . not because it was good , remember , but because it spoke that little spot in our hearts that loves those kinds of stories . the fact that it was kind of poorly written just made it that much better .
it s her life and she has to live it . i ca nt live it for her . she is aware of her choices and there are many people who will be quick to point out that this is my problem , not hers . others will jump to tell me that i should keep this stuff to myself .
my mother used to push me , thank god for my mother , of cause thank god for my father he loved me but he was always in the farm . when other children are playing outside , my mother will ask me to seat down and study my books , and i will tell her other people are enjoying .
my advice is , come in at whatever level is convenient for you now , i trust my god that as he begins to bless you , you ll keep on moving higher and there will be people who will enter in group two or three today before this time next year , they will already be in group ten .
for me , we 're just about ready to launch the new website i 've been working on since january . this past week , i had to work some very late nights getting things ready . i ca n't wait until about hours from now when it 's finally up and running and i can take a moment to breathe
i love them all equally , she says , you know , just like your mother tells you she love all of you , all your brothers and sisters the same like yeah whatever so yeah , i love them all equally , because , like , you know , i do nt want any of them to get upset .
it is with mixed emotion that i stand here to share my thoughts . this is a time of celebration for you celebrating an anniversary of a beginning for the white man in america . a time of looking back , of reflection . it is with a heavy heart that i look back upon what happened to my people .
in the process of choosing happiness , i sometimes think that depression can be an odd sort of blessing . as if it turns the world upside down for three days so that once we see the world right side up again we ll better appreciate what we see . and this time , we wo nt see it alone .
playing poker games is the amusement , which is enjoyable by person of all era . at today s present time it has become a passion to play online poker and the peoples are slowly but surely showing their preference towards this game . if you love taking risks and adventure thus playing poker online is just perfect for you .
from my own experience , i d say that it truly is a great thing if you re looking for variety in your work life but it also means that you have to be able to adapt , adjust your train of thought at a moment s notice and hit the ground running on any number of wide ranging tasks .
i got the recipe from my mother in law , who lives in the buffalo area . i thought the name open faced chicago sandwiches was funny , because i 'm originally from the chicago area and never had anything like them there . but since that 's the way it came to me , i 'll use it here .
today was just one of those days that i have to stop and take a moment to show my gratitude . it was nt any one thing that made the day so fantastic although a few of these things were awesome all on their own , but it was the combination of all of them that made it simply amazing .
many people do not have group insurance programs that offer long term disability coverage . if you became sick or injured and could work for an extended period of time where would the money come from to pay the monthly bills unlike life insurance , you are around first hand to see the financial challenges of not having an income .
some believe that good food should come from a good restaurant . i never buy that since good restaurant always come with a higher price . in my opinion , good food can be everywhere , from fine dining restaurant to a street food stall . especially in south east asia , where food is always at the corner of your eyes
my almost three year old has nt yet developed the logic to deal with fears . but i expect that she and her sister will one day simply grow out of the night light . it ll probably be about the time they start to push me away and order me to drop them off around the corner from their school .
k and i try hard to be realistic about oldest about each of them and we think this is a perfect fit for him , but there 's a steep learning curve being in a small shop with three other people for long hours every day , six days a week , and he loves it but we know it 's hard
even though baby hunter is n't arriving until summer , we are all anxious to outfit his new space . i came up with this design board for my brother and his wife after they told me that they wanted baby jungle animals . i found the bedding at target for only and we used that as our jumping off point .
i heard this story the other night . it was about an older couple . they have lived their lives . they made it to the end . i do nt know the exact details of how they lived their lives , but this story is telling of the love they shared well call the wife rose and the husband bud .
let me know what you think and do n't forget to click on the link above to see all the details for the contest . plus you can see what a few more of the designers did with this month 's sketch while you 're there too . sure hope you 'll join in on the fun with this month 's challenge
well , it s been an extremely busy few weeks . it s not really going to stop being busy until week from today , so we ll see how it goes . i feel like i ve been running around like a chicken with its head cut off turning in and writing papers and taking exams it has definitely been crazy
so i 'm getting back into the swing of things after having the baby . i 'm actually all booked out until the end of the year mostly because i 'm cutting back so i do n't totally loose it and will be posting some sessions i 've done recently . life is already getting back to normal and busy , busy
when i heard this would be an album start to finish gig and then a few hits i was n't quite sure if i 'd like it . in the end the ' album ' was one giant minute song and the ' hits ' was almost the length of a regular set so it turned out to be pretty awesome .
they also suggested , while at work , taking the long way back to your desk . however , you probably ought to be holding onto some papers so looks like you are busy while wandering around the office , otherwise people may just think that you are lost or do nt have anything to do , which is a possibility .
what could he possibly have to show me what was this special thing he was about to share with me my heart started to race . i was n't sure if it was from anticipation of what he might bring back or out of fear that he was going to show me more clothes . he returned with a photo album .
almost a day does nt go by where i do nt get an email or see a post on beer advocate with people asking about what kind of beer related things to do in st. louis . so , i thought it would be a good idea to put together a list of great craft beer spots in the metro area .
in michigan , we are emerging from these difficult economic times , but we still have many families who continue to weather this storm . in fact , , michigan residents currently receive state of federal unemployment benefits in michigan . now is not the time to pull the rug out from those who need assistance to provide for their families .
since i got accepted , i would lie awake in my bed thinking and worrying . this program is going to cost more money then what i had originally thought and it made me nervous . i knew i should just trust god , but it is never that easy for me . so i would pray and eventually fall asleep .
no matter how much people insist that i am worthy and should love myself , i know i am a person who is dark inside . there is no love in there . i do n't know if i was born broken or if something in life made me this way , but i simply have nothing to offer the world .
for long trips , like the one home , i have started doing vocal warm ups and cursing the fact that you ca nt stand while singing in the car causing your breath support to suck and making those high notes in do nt stop believing nearly impossible to hit with a full voice . these warm ups accomplish two helpful things
so divorce . . . i think it s important to stress first that the term divorce can refer to a couple of different situations . the most important point to consider in terms of legal history are . who is allowed to request the divorce and . what grounds , if any , are required for divorce to be considered .
i never had a you can have whatever you want childhood , and was encouraged to save my money . my mum told me that i could buy whatever i wanted if i saved up . they wanted to make sure i understood the value of money , and i think that was one of the best lessons i ever learned .
what happened is that the girl blew into town , called up a male friend and they went out for a meal and then back to her hotel room . she filed a workers ' compensation claim for ' facial and psychological injuries ' she suffered when a glass light fitting came away from the wall above the bed during their activities
here 's my advice on that make connections with people who seem to be on a similar path and take those relationships outside of the content mill community . email or chat via messenger . networking is an important component of a successful writing career , and there 's nothing saying you ca n't find decent writers in content mill communities .
i imagine that 's part of the reason why happiness is hard to find . instead of worrying about why it went away , or who was the one at fault for taking it away , or even the commonly sought after question when will i be happy again , he best way to learn happiness starts with one three letter word
i am no photographer obviously , just look at the pictures but over the past few years , i came across views that really capture my attention . during those times , i feel it necessary to snap a picture , using whatever is available yes , sometimes even a camera phone to capture a specific scene , a specific moment .
i m not sure how this turned into a girl who is actually a flower or is wearing a dress which is a flower oh my god , i have no idea . do i ever have any idea no , i do nt . things just turn out like this , im sorry i just never know what i m doing
my darling , this is to tell you in a very mild way how terribly much i love you , miss you , need you and want you near me always . safe trip my love . rest , relax and think of me burning myself out with this terrible longing of you , for you . i love you so .
for keith , it was important that he stay true to his values . that s not always an easy decision to make , however , especially if you have family depending on you . sometimes it s much easier just to go with the flow , to convince yourself that you can work to change the company from the inside .
' this ' is not me . i wish that i could wake up tomorrow and feel normal just like i used to a year ago . some days i just want to cry . some days , i do . but mostly , i just wish that they 'll figure out what 's wrong with me and make me better .
after an incredibly busy day yesterday , which involved spending way too much time in the car driving all over the metro for a variety of reasons , we made today a quiet day . we did little besides cook , eat , and lounge , although we did get out for a walk this afternoon . here 's today in food
as you probably know , mr williams is an extremely dangerous man . he would not think twice about your life , and will certainly silence anyone who has had contact with him and could testify against him in a court of law . he always covers his tracks , which is why he has been so difficult to hunt down .
lord , please help me not be so determined to have a picnic that i miss what you re saying . help me to be open to your plan for my day , and for my life . show me the path you d have me take . help me pay attention to the words that are coming out of your mouth
all he knew was he loved her . but he had fallen and landed somewhere on this vast planet without any way to find her . all he had was the image of her face and the overwhelming feeling of love for her that caused every part of his body to hurt even more than the pain of his broken bones .
now that the kitchen is done with , i am trying to get back into the challenge which when i think about it seems pointless because of some things that are coming down the line , but i ll talk about those if when they happen . so here s what i ve missed and my catching up to the current challenge
life rarely goes according to our plans , i know that most of all . but i wish , just once , that it would go according to my plan , that my life would turn out how i want it to be , that i would win , just this once . i feel like i do nt know anything anymore .
oh goodness . i do nt even know how to put everything into words . there are so many emotions running through me recently and i m worried that i do nt know how to cope with them . i guess i m just gon na write out everything that has been going on . maybe that will make me feel better .
however , even if you have no interest in doing the writer any good , or bn any good , or agents any good , it 's still worthwhile because the real person you 're helping is the potential reader who can now find a book looking where they should and not confusing someone who found the book in the inappropriate section .
note to readers i have been asked to remove personal details about the actual memorial proceedings today . i do however reserve the right to reflect on my own life journey s as not only a writer but as a human being . out of respect for my family s right to privacy , i have modified this entry and re posted .
lord , thank you for teaching me how to love others . thank you for loving me and setting that perfect example . reading your word is giving me patience with my children . it is reminding me to show love in all i do . thank you so much for your guidelines and examples . speak to me today . amen .
well , i 'm off to finish dinner and rest . my brain ca n't take too much in one day . i 'm also working on a major construction in children 's ministry that will start next week . all your prayers that i can handle both projects , sunday children 's ministry and my own house chores without feeling overwhelmed .
we do nt need to fear the devil and his demons because god has given us authority over evil beings . they must obey us unless they have a basis for ownership in our inner lives . but believers must know that demons are more abundant and present than many people realize and need to learn their strategies , for effective defense .
i used to wonder when it was that i 'd feel like a grown up . getting married did n't do it . working a real job where i wore a suit every day , did n't do it . buying a house , even having a child , i still felt like a child myself playing in this grown up world .
but saturday i did just that . i smoked my goal i set at the beginning of the year , to finish a k in under minutes . honestly two months ago that sounded almost out of reach for me . but the more i run and the more i train , the more i surprise myself with what i can do .
however , i have completed many books . i know its a shock . to be honest some books i completed in studies , but there have been a few that i have read on my own . i thought i would share my top non fiction study books that have challenged me , inspired me and encouraged me in my walk .
you are worth it . you are worth the extra time to spend on yourself . to make you feel better about yourself . if you are feeling miserable , you have the strength inside of you to change . trust me . it gets better your life is not horrible , but the way you are treating your life is horrible .
i loved so many things about it . even though it did take up a lot of my time , it forced me to post every day , even if it was just something short . and after the challenge , it definitely left me relieved that i only had to post monday , wednesday and friday for the rest of the year
it s quite a strange sensation , being awake , looking out the window knowing the rest of the immediate world are probably sleeping . i can see right along my street and all the houses are in darkness , even the streetlight has stopped working directly opposite which really makes this street a dark place until the sun begins to rise .
i told her a little about camp , but she did nt seem interested . my mom met us , and struck up a conversation , and after that i did nt talk any more . that afternoon , as i tried on various pants and shirts , i felt truly free . i could walk away from her and not care .
but then i am reminded that the one who is bringing her into our family has not missed a thing . he was there when she was born and the day she was given away . he knows what makes her laugh and what makes her cry . he has been by her side for every one of her many hospital stays .
anyways gary has been traveling since and has hit up so many places , i doubt i will be able to see even half of what he s done in my lifetime . in he finally visited spain and recently he published a wonders of spain list here is the link to his post if you would like to read it there httpeverythingeverywhere.comthesevenwondersofspain
i absolutely was not compensated for this post . not even one hot wing . we just really enjoy this restaurant , it 's a part of our history and it was fun to share it with our kiddos . if you ever drive by one , turn around at the next exit . seriously , those wings are worth the extra hour
we also have the light of life . we are told in matthew , we are the light of the world . a city on a hill can not be hidden . neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . instead they put it on a stand , and it gives light to everyone in the house .
step cut strips of paper to wrap around the candy bars . i used scrapbook paper , make sure it does n't have a pattern on the back . this was a good way to use up some that i had in a stack and probably would n't have picked to actually use in my scrapbook . i cut mine . by .
i thought that sharing the first chapter of my novel , a life without , would give you a better idea of who i am and what i write . for those of you on my personal page , i m sorry to post this again but i m hoping my new fans will love it as much as you all have .
this morning , in the morning sun , the mountains looked gorgeous with their new white coats , and they were just brilliant in the west . i did n't get a pic for you right then it was a crazy morning around here but i did get one now . it 's always a good day if i can see the mountains
after paying for the product online , one can get instant access to the product . the product can be ordered from any location as delivery will be done to respective county . coming to the fees of the program , it cost that is a one time fee . this is pretty affordable compared to other programs that charge higher fees .
all of that is what it is . i 've relaxed there though and i 'm used to things being chaos . it 's not a reflection of who i am as a woman and where i drop the ball . it 's just a reflection of what life looks like and it 's neither good or bad . it just is .
use your imagination for just a moment . imagine that your best friend walks up to you in your garden one saturday and asks you to do him a favour . you have some free time , and so you agree to do it . he walks over to his car , opens the trunk , and produces a thirty pound rock .
just having had the soccer world cup in south africa last year , it s an absolutely unique experience that you should have at least once . it does nt really matter which sport , but be there amongst the crowd in the stadium to witness one of the final games of the event in person . the vibe is totally amazing .
long story short guess it 's too late for that , this is a cool thing to do , but only if you have the financial resources to use aka rental cars , food , plane tickets , time off work , etc . plus there are several people selling their time shares online for a lot cheaper and for more credits .
i could n't believe the number of people who commented saying they had the same problem . then i remembered a tv show i 'd seen years ago on the same topic . the host asked people if they were aware of the type of look that was on their face when they were resting and not thinking about anything in particular .
as i m about to go on a date tomorrow , i d like to visit something that happens every single time i date a girl . and when i say every single time , i mean every single fucking time . luckily , this thing has nt happened with this woman yet , but it s only a matter of time .
their political game , and just push the idea that the state has no authority nor does it have any business regulating marriage at all in the first place it s a private contract between two individuals , no need for a third party this issue would be gone . but as long as we bow the knee and get the state 's
not all at once though that might make for quite the book . i realized i was way behind in my book posts with all my cooking lately and i was promised a new cake challenge from wales anyway , i figured i should be literary for a little while if nothing else , it is an effective way to avoid grading papers
k i loved that about it . it does that sort of i m gon na have a conversation about music and then i m gon na have a conversation about faith and then i m gon na have a conversation about family , and all those things are linked , all those things make sense as part of a larger conversation .
and if that were nt enough , the vintage virginia wine festival will be taking place about four miles from our house all weekend long . time to clear some space on the wine rack . i know , tough task . so let s get down to business . i ll save you the . miles and get straight to the wine .
then i thought if you have an odd pillow case scrap fabric etc that fits the feel of my ' therapy quilt ' i would love to add it too . it would make this quilt so much more special to my family and in years to come the quilt will become the story of our journey through this time of our lives .
i took the boys to the mall on friday night , which is a minute drive for us . i was amazed at the lack of whining and thoroughly enjoyed shopping for dad with my guys . they always surprise me with what they get for one another . it really is sweet , and their gift ideas are so well thought out .
you have visited and seen the lives of those who raised you in a historical sense . you will need to be able to see them as the natural consequence of the events , beliefs and what you can know about their feelings as their own personalities developed over time . their years from before your birth up until your adolescence are critical .
if you want to know what s happening around town , there is a quick listing of events on the home page and a full calendar as well . click on any event within the calendar and all the details for that particular event will pop up . the site will also feature weekly restaurant specials on the home page along with weather updates
teach your kids to be responsible chores are good for a child . turn on the music , give them a dustcloth , and see how much work you can do together in minutes . many hands make light work , but learning to do things on their own teaches them character also . even young children can learn to gather the trash .
now , i ca n't get enough of the amazing race . watch out , people . someday , as soon as i 'm done having babies and done nursing and my kids are old enough to take care of themselves , gary and i are taking off and we 'll win that million dollars . if it 's still on the air .
o , the pressure . as much fun it is to go beer shopping , this time i felt pressure . this was big time . this was n't a usual trade . this was a trade with a real beer guy . a man who knows his beer . my reputation was on the line . i needed to do it right .
one winner will get to choose any one book of his her choice from the list of anticipated near may releases below . and trust me , there are a lot of amazing ones this month but if you would like another book that releases around this time instead , i could definitely substitute that in as long as it 's under usd .
as a man , most people usually assume that men who wear pink shirts are either gay , fashionable , or wearing a formerly white shirt that s been washed with the wrong color . but for me , i simply just like pink . red is too strong , and pink is pleasant . makes people around you think of you differently .
also , we have many tours right now that are less than five people . if a tour does n't get five people signed up , it will not run . it takes a lot of time to keep everything going smoothly , and it 's hard to keep everything straight with a lot of tours with less than five people on them .
you do need to have a costco membership for the maximum discount , but i think it would still be worth your time to call and see if you could be saving some . i thought pete was very nice and helpful and answered all my questions to make sure we were getting the same or better coverage as what we currently have .
i went for pure clean and simple with this card , as i felt that this sweet , tender moment between father child needed to be kept centre stage . i did n't want any other distractions from it , not even a sentiment on the front . i figured that the insert could do the job of the sentiment just as well .
next gig yes look out for details of our next gig here soon . it 'll be in the london area on october st . that 's friday october , st , fact fans . for those of you counting that 'll be our second show in no less than months . they do n't call us the hardest working band in britain .
i told her it was nice to meet her but i could nt really chat things were very intense and it was finally time for jack to make his grand entrance . jake kept asking if he could do anything for me and i remember telling him to just not ask me any questions . the nurse henrietta who was fantastic was on my
the second batch arrived on a saturday , and were just perfect for an afternoon cup of tea after a big shop . i love peanut butter biscuits and these from amy at the weekly bake off were fantastic i do n't know why i 've never thought of adding chocolate chips to peanut butter biscuits , but i will be from now on
i 'm figuring if they 're taking the time to request new paperwork , talk to management and such , we 're headed in the right direction or why would they bother it sounds like maybe they 're really wanting to sell finally and that perhaps they 're a little nervous since getting a k loan is getting harder and harder to get .
i was determined to go to church and have a great time and see people and go home and have house church over and have a great time and then spend the evening to myself , probably lesson planning for this week . i did none of those things , at least not how i intended to . this is a long story .
more than once i have been asked the likes of , where were you twenty years ago had i known this message of grace then , it would have made all the difference in the world in my life . my reply is usually the same . would you have believed it twenty years ago the answer is almost always the same no .
there is a game here at this house called the ' honey game ' . it is really just an imaginary game of house not unlike any that get played in many houses around the world . ours is named ' honey game ' because my girls got it in their heads that couples that are married call each other ' honey ' .
or like right this fucking moment . i m thinking about going and getting one because i want to smoke really , really , really fucking bad what i do not want to do is start eating every fucking thing in sight i do nt want to get big as a fucking house because i actually need to lose weight , not gain it .
my husband is a grad student and we were hoping that after more quick years we would finally be able to settle down somewhere , he 'd get an amazing job , we 'd buy a house and give our kids the kind of life we really want them to have . and now we are not sure how that will all work out .
how did things end for these people we went back to see the lady we prayed with a couple of days later and she did nt know anything about her pancreas yet , but she said that after we had prayed for her the pain in her was gone . she told us yet once again that she knew we were sent by god .
note depending on how spicy you like it , you can use more or less red pepper . the one teaspoon here gives it a pretty good kick , so i 'd try that first before using more . however , i would not recommend omitting it altogether unless you are adding meat to the sauce , which will give it some extra flavor .
nick green , who i interviewed last year , says in the same article , i am not going to kid myself that i can support my family by writing fiction . at best it is extra pocket money . i would never give up the day job not even if my next advance was six figures , because another might never come again .
growing up , i never read any of the dead white guys or girls or living white guys or girls . besides pride and prejudice and little women both giving to me when i was years old i did not have much contact with white writers growing up . i mainly read black authors . which is good for a black girl growing up .
by the way , one thing i always admire about my husband is that he buy flowers all the time for me . he buy them even when it is not a special occasion . i think it is nice to get flowers just because . it shows that he cares and thinks about me even when it is not anniversary or special day .
i used the director s cut for this review , so i watched the best possible version in order to be absolutely fair . it did not help , which bugs me . robert wise directed one of my favorite films of all time , much less in the science fiction genre theday the earth stood still . i expected much better from him .
i should probably take my own advice , but in all honesty i just do nt want to . i have beautiful boys at the moment and i m not ready nor willing to lose the man who gave me such a beautifully perfect son however i also know that i ca nt make someone put effort into something they do nt want to .
you wrapped me up in a hug and i knew that i needed to go . i could feel it and i knew that you could as well . it was just getting too hard to keep staying . i ll wait for you . it was a statement so simple that it managed to easily hide one of a soldier s biggest fears .
you ca nt stop time from passing or slow it down no matter how hard you try . i hope to god i never have a mid life crisis , although sometimes i wonder if i m having a mid s crisis but that s another post . all i can do is live for today , tomorrow , and the day after that .
careful , he said . careful put in some more butter oh , no . you 're cooking too many at once . too many turn them now . we need more butter oh my god , where are we going to get more butter they 're going to stick careful , careful , careful you never listen to me when you 're cooking .
sight right now i 'm staring at an enormous pile of clothes that really could use to be folded . steve is starting to fold them as he watches a basketball game on tv ... while i 'm supposed to be looking at my online lesson plans for work ... but instead i 'm really staring at the sunday senses button up on my screen
all right , that s enough . i deploy this evening and have to drop this letter off at the shelter . i do nt think i ll say another good bye to tank , though . i cried too much the first time . maybe i ll peek in on him and see if he finally got that third tennis ball in his mouth
after our first vancouver city day we took more of the fine local public transport including the skytrain a metro up high back to north van as it s called locally . there we met a batch of cousins old and new back at base for a lovely evening s dinner and a movie . our first set of vancouver and around photos are here
it all started last weekend . i was busy each day could feel i was fighting a cold . i pushed through because i needed to get ready for my first craft show on saturday more on this later . by tuesday , i was done for and out of commission for the next two days . i 'm back to about today , finally
i 'm also trying to convince our six year old that having her own bedroom will be amazing and wonderful and full of pink without shocking our senses . one night i even made up a story about a princess with her name moving to a new castle house . that 's how desperate i am for this transition to be a positive one .
pull those neutrals out of your stash and see how rich they can be when used as the featured fabrics . we have lots of great neutrals in stock and new ones coming soon , so get yourself a copy of this fabulous book , a few new fabrics and let the inspiration begin you will never look at neutrals in the same way again
thank you for the gifts and abilities that you have given me . help me to step out in faith and to use those gifts to bless others and to bring you glory . teach me to be available to your call and the direction of the holy spirit . use me today to reach others for eternity . in jesus name , amen .
i would like to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with buying something and making it pretty . there s no rule that says you have to make everything yourself . for example , tie a fancy silk ribbon around a really good slice of cheese from your favorite cheese shop and present it with pride along with a bottle of nice wine .
. there was boot washed up on shore . how often does that happen if i had gone fishing last week there s a chance that i could have caught it . i think that would have been quite exciting . perhaps i m the only one , but when something from a cartoon happens in real life , i find it incredibly exciting .
iran s charming little president has called on china , russia , and some other countries to form an alliance against the evil west . he began his speech with the following exercise in self righteous historical revisionism which one of our countries has played a role in the black era of slavery , or in the destruction of hundreds of millions of human beings
i never thought of myself as aggressive , but i guess i am . i wonder if that s a bad thing . maybe yes and maybe no . guess it depends on the situation . i think it s worked well for me most of my life , but there was at least one time when being too aggressive cost me a friend .
normally i am not a frozen pizza girl . do n't get me wrong i love pizza but the frozen one 's are usually pretty disappointing . i tried this pizza at my parents house and loved it . it had great flavors and the spinach and goat cheese were the perfect light combination . this is one frozen pizza i will be buying .
so know that with every door you knock on , truly , with every call you make , with every conversation you have , you have to remember that this could be the one that makes the difference truly , every interaction , the first lady said . you could be the one who inspires that person to make their voice heard this november .
i , on the other hand , am sitting here trying to tell you what i am feeling simply by what i can see . if i had to sum it up , it would involve something like running and dancing through a field to the tune of a mash up of both the start of something new and i m walking on sunshine .
preheat the oven to degrees . put the potato slices into a large pot of cold water . there should be just enough water to cover the potatoes . bring the water to a boil and add the salt . cook the potatoes for about minutes or until they are just shy of fork tender . they should be cooked about of the way .
so , thinking about worrying and anxiety has been a very interesting and useful process for me , but the real test will be what i choose to do with my newly found insights . i literally do not know what it feels like to not worry , but i have a feeling that i 'm soon going to find out . . . .
i know for a fact there are other innocent men in prison , williams said to the crowd gathered after the hearing . you will not get the proper representation if you are poor , he added . a lot of them had to cop out to cases that they knew they was innocent on because they did nt want to face the jury .
debbie did try to sort of cheer herself up , she said , i know , it ll happen one day . i could nt offer her any encouragement . that one day can turn into a year and then into decades . all i could tell her was that the sadness about being single comes in waves . it s not always really intense .
thanks so much for reading i ve loved every moment of the journey so far . if you love to write , my advice is go for it you may never become rich , but i guarantee it ll add an extra dimension to your life and put the sparkle back in your eyes . so here s to the next posts to many more adventures
so with that in mind i set to work . only when i had finished i realised that i could not really enter it into the challenge as it did not meet the less is more rules it was a bit too busy , and not enough ' white space ' . but i liked it , so thought that i would post it anyway .
as a way to show some love to my followers , i m giving away a gift card to everyone s favorite go to store target my current followers are automatically entered to win . that s right , you do nt have to do a thing , just make sure i have your email address so that i can email you if you win .
and i cried . for a long time . because i still miss him after all of these years and because leaving this home is so painful and because it just felt so good to let everything out and not have to put a smile on it because little people are watching me . i just let it all out and it was a relief .
responded with my name , and in turn asked for his , boy he replied . that was about the extent of our first interaction , but there was something in that little voice and those innocent eyes i d never seen before . i ca nt explain it , but as i walked away from that little boy i had a feeling i was in
i m beat i am seriously so exhausted and because i work every third weekend , i hate sitting at home on the two weekends in a row i m off . but i ca nt even fathom putting makeup on after taking a shower right now . i came home and sat on my couch for a good ten minutes without moving at all .
little claire 's have released their club satmp for may and oh they are so cute the set includes a gorgeous stamp featuring king robert queen daisy and a fab circle sentiment . also there is a pack included with materials and instructions to make a complete card and instructions to make two more . here are the details of how to join the club .
i laughed . actually , it would not be a good decision to buy everything with our money . i saw a teaching moment on the horizon and reached for it . we should talk to god and ask him what he wants us to do with the money he gives us . then , we can spend the money on only the best things .
it was such a great time that i had with dear cloud i came to know each of the members better during the interview . at the end of the interview , they also left a shout out to all the fans through their facebook fan page , to thank all who have been supporting them and to give a lot of love to bright lights
with today 's post , you may be wondering if you 've already ' been here . ' i assure you , this is not the twilight zone in fact , we are doing a ' re hop ' on these fabulous eyes of beauty and dreams collection for susana loves stamps we just love them so much , we wanted to share them again d
i made my last cheesecake pictured with homemade cream cheese . i am not going to get into that right now , but it was more wet than block cream cheese from the store , thus my cheesecake was more moist . it was delicious , but the picture does not look exactly like the cheesecake normally . it gets higher , and more firm .
i have n't lost any more weight , but even though i 've cut out the sugar my daily eating is still pretty high in calories because i 've been hungry and eating a lot . so hopefully as the time goes on and my hunger switch goes back to normal , i should cut down on the amount of food too and lose weight .
when you look around and there is nobody else in the restaurant except of the employees , the lights are turned up and the tv 's are off it is usually a good sign that you should leave now . i do n't understand how people do n't get this . the place is closed , time to go , is that so hard to understand
my job was to guide and educate those who call us for help about their virus related computer problems , with virus being a catch all word for anything that s wrong with the software . so it s like teaching in a sense . the only difference is that we were talking to really stupid people who in turn made you even more stupid .
remember to post your projects using inlinkz no later than noon central time on friday , july , . we will announce the winner of the stamp set and the new top mouse award winners when the new sketch challenge is posted on saturday , july . please use a direct link to your project and feel free to enter as many times as you like
i remember sitting down one day , totally exhausted and not ready at all to have my second child but by then he was ready to come soon . i opened up god s word and he spoke to me and told me not to fear , that he will take hold of me by his hand . what an encouragement that was for me .
reward and recognition is a feedback process for teachers , a quality feedback process is as much about students reflecting on information as it is about students receiving it . the same holds for leaders . as teachers and leaders we want to recognize high performance . recognition as feedback can be applied by the leader , by the teacher , and by student peers .
phew are you still here if so , to sum up , i think everyone needs a first novel . whether it 's successful or not . because regardless of what stage you are in with the writing game , you 're going to have to face all of the emotional ups and downs that come with being brave enough to call yourself a writer .
a very quick post to say that we re home , safe and sound we had a wonderful time , and even more than that i got to spend some quality time with my daughter . i will be posting an absolute ton of pictures and stories soon . just about everything we saw and did was incredible and i ca nt wait to share .
i think we need to see more women breastfeeding their babies in public whether it be in photos or in real life , it should be a sight that everyone in the country sees on a regular basis because until that happens women are always going to feel like they are doing something wrong when they are doing the most natural thing in the world .
as parents it is hard to find the time to still be intimate with each other . by intimate i mean having the sex . not together during the day and tired as hell by the time you get the kids to bed . usually i let my wife know that i ll have sex dreams about her if she does the same for me .
here is a sample of some of the artwork i colored from this new collection . it was fun to work on something so large . we have some posters that are x and some posters that are up to x . wow that gives you a lot of space to create a beautiful work of art for your home or as a custom gift .
that being said , i have always been a big fan of education i did become a teacher after all and firmly believe that most of what a person needs to know in life is not learned by sitting quietly in a desk and taking notes . here are a few lessons i learned from rock and roll , one of the greatest teachers around .
how did i get this lucky i 'm really not sure . i guess it 's because we were meant for each other and we held out for each other instead of settling for relationships that may have been convenient at the time . i also know for a fact that god had huge role in guiding my life towards eric . thank you , jesus
i 'm not going to give you a recipe , because it 's that easy in the morning , turn your slow cooker onto medium and program it for at least hours . i sliced up an onion , placed the pork on top and added about a th cup water to the pot . cover and dinner will be ready when you get home .
i do n't know about all of you , but i love my room . sadly , i do n't get to spend as much time there as i would like , but when i do , i take a deep breath and chill out . i need to remember to do this more often . my room houses a few of my favorite things .
while chicken is cooking boil the eggs . i do this by placing the eggs in a pot , covering with cold water and bringing to a boil . i boil for min and then cover the pot and remove from heat . i let sit in the hot water for mins then immediately place into a bowl of ice water and let cool completely .
school starts tomorrow , which in and of itself is no big deal . my kids will be back in the classroom , and it 's a big year for our oldest because he 's a senior . i 'm trying not to think about how fast the year will go and how much my heart is going to break when he goes to college .
i sometimes think it would be a good idea to write in silence . like , it would be more pure or something . but with two small kids , the idea of actually achieving silence is pretty much impossible . it 's either write to music or write to the sound of epic action figure battles in the next room . which sometimes i do .
the argument will be raised that america is a nation of immigrants , but that was then and this is now . the earlier flow of immigrants from ireland , scotland , italy , germany and russia were needed in the s to provide workers for the nation s industrial base and as farmers for its expanding land mass . and they were white and christian .
shouting at your husband in front of his friends is typical of a woman who is not in love . true african love means asking no questions and smiling even when things are wrong . even where you are more intelligent than your lover , act like you do not know anything . being a fool to give your husband greater glory is love beyond measure .
how differently would your life be if you were strong enough to be consistent have you made choices that you regret , but you were under pressure and felt like you had to react would your relationships be better if you were nt so moved by people not living up to your expectations would you be living life at a higher level if you were more motivated
finally and most importantly , i can contribute by bringing issues of youth engagement and voice in the support for the creation of effective educational systems . the issue of providing opportunities for youth to be actively involved in their own learning and educational system has not been included and in this changing environment it is necessary for our youth to be part of the system .
i told him we better have a plan on how to keep those chicks alive if we lose power . thirty seconds later boom no power . the wind was fierce and i was concerned about the trees coming down , but the storm only lasted about five minutes and then all was calm . of course the rain never stopped , this is oregon you know
i wanted to expand that a bit with this post and offer a printable notebook page to use to follow up your extraordinary in the ordinary outdoor time . i challenge you to find at least one thing to take a closer look and to then complete a notebook page or nature journal showing what you learned . my family will be participating in this challenge too
oh . so something about that baby being born way back then has something to do with me not fearing . well , sure . i know , he is my savior so on the last day when i stand at judgement i do n't need to fear because christ saved me from my sins . but what about today what about everyday between now and then
explaining to an almost three year old that my belly wo n't be going anywhere anytime soon and that it will soon be replaced with someone who will rock his world even more is nearly impossible . it seems like little brother or sister is already getting a head start in marking their territory . poor big brother has no idea what is about to hit him
what strikes me now is the incredible care with which i made the scrapbook . that was n't at all like me . i was slapdash and casual in those days . it was almost as if my unconscious mind drove me to keep that record , because one day and even then i knew i was going to be a writer i would need it .
and , now i feel better and feel able to give it another go . i wanted to share this because there have been other times i have wanted to just quit something and had many reasons to do so however , by staying the course and reaching deep into my creativity and patience i ultimately experienced a benefit to my skills and feelings of worth .
they girls slept from ish to about am , with the exception of one of them who called her mom at pm and went home homesick . and one that left at who was n't planning on staying the night . we made it through with very little drama and the girls were picked up at am . all in all , not a horrible experience .

my hope is to update more often about the everyday stuff that happens in our life , it s just that the everyday stuff happens to be everything i have just written and then some . the then some part will have to wait for another day . thanks as always for your thoughts and prayers , love and support , we could not do this alone
i reflected on everything as joe drove me home . was this his idea of a date was this what he did with girls i made some small talk as we pulled into my driveway . he put the car in park , turned to me , his beautiful blue eyes peering into mine and said the words i had waited to hear since th grade .
she was stared at . the kids asked questions about her and then moved on to playing with the other kids . the adults stared some more . she was n't having fun . i was n't having fun . and our incredible , awesome , loving nurse , would never have said she was n't having fun . but i 'm sure she was n't .
recently , library cuts have been a major topic in the world of literature in britain . the financial crisis and the resulting government cuts mean that many libraries will need to close down . because who really borrows books these days when the internet offers information for free or next to nothing , and you do n't even need to leave your house to do so
california is gaining status in the beer world . that 's awesome because i make it to the land of movies quite often . luckily , that is where i am now stop by and say hi if you 're in the area . i have been here for days now and i feel like i 'm failing in my search for great west coast beer .
you can add things to the calendar the same way . you can make cards with chores and stick them in the pocket . so when you see it that day you have to do what the card says . also , you can make cards with activities you want to do with your child , like art , museum visit , a game , etc .
but dawn ca nt help feeling that her life would have worked out rather differently had gina and pete been able to adopt her in the first place . it is absurd that social services thought they were acting in my best interests , says dawn . i think i would have a good case against them in court , given the stress i have suffered .
but have no fear i already have a handful of agents waiting in the wings to do interviews and judge more rounds of an agent s inbox , so when we come back in april , we ll pick up right where we left off . in the meantime , i ll do my best to figure out this whole taking care of three kids thing .
but we ca nt complain the clothes look interesting on paper you can see sketches in the video below , and photos of the dress donatella wore to her men s show yesterday and we re excited to see how they wear when they reach stores later this year . take a look for yourself and tell us if you ll be buying any of it .
over the several months , i 'm going to share ideas that inspire me and just might work for you , too . they 'll be presented one bite at a time , just quick posts every saturday . but i 'd love for readers and other bloggers alike to join me in building a list that inspires and encourages each and every one of us .
moving on , i have stuff to do now including but not limited to sorting old toys into different categories . it 's important . so i 'm gon na go . i hope you all hate me less after this , and i also hope it will last a while , cause i somehow ca n't imagine myself writing another post any time really soon .
i definitely get most of my inspiration from challenges like yours and love to try to combine two or three challenges in one card . to enter a challenge really inspires me to try to make something different , try new techniques or color combos , to do my best and not take the easy way out and just make cards that i m comfortable making .
. it s too dark in the morning to wake up . we did nt wake up this morning , because my boys were convinced it was way too early to get up , when in fact , it was am . however , being the mean mom that i am , i made them all hurry up and get ready , and go to school .
. have your closest friends and family members take the following survey . they have to know you extremely well , otherwise it 's going to be all over the place . it 's only four questions , and some of them may seem silly , so make sure they take it seriously . i 've added some answers people said about me as possible examples .
because anna is so passionate about creating awareness of the positive impact women are currently having on our world , i am excited to announce that she will be here on a monthly basis . i am grateful for anna s willingness to take time out of her very full life as a wife , mother , and blogger to commit to sharing her passion for inspiring others
truth be told , i struggled as to how to carry out this mission . reading the previous mission reports , i wanted to do something different , but eventually realized that if i did n't start , i 'd be just over thinking things , knowing that i just had to go out there and see what happens . so i did this past saturday night .
i think it also says that you appreciate craft and creativity . these designs are all hand drawn from my inspiration and influences . so i guess that each design has a meaning and is not produced only to please the management or the market researchers . like i said before , we see our t shirts in a small way as a piece of illustrated art .
however , although men and women are equal , they are not the same . they have different purposes . it is part of allah s design and purpose for men and women to have different physical characteristics likewise it is the duty of a man to provide for the financial needs of his family , and for the woman to look after the home and family .
i 'm fine with people making mistakes i 've made my fair share of them over the years and actually appreciate when someone can be open and honest about it . it 's a breath of fresh air to hear someone say i 'm sorry ... i made a mistake . it shows me that you are responsible enough to admit and take ownership of the error .
the home in question is long thought by sixteen year old jacob to be a place entirely existing only in his grandfather 's imagination . when his grandfather dies suddenly , jacob begins a journey towards the truth but will he believe it when he sees it and what if that truth opens the door to something far darker and more insidious than anything he has ever known
one of the things that i love about living on the east coast is the abundance of historic locations and structures . take , for example , the setting for these pictures . the building was once used as a mill and dates to . it feels awe inspiring to be in the presence of buildings that have been in existence since a nation 's formative years .
to start with , the ward is fantastic hugely overwhelming because there are a million people with new ones every week , but the young moms in particular have been so welcoming to me which really means a lot . i had a calling within a month of being here . i feel pretty well integrated already with obviously much more getting to know people to come .
i guess if the world ends tomorrow , it definitely will have deserved it . thanks to following the norm and being able to get into high positions anywhere in the world . people that make choices that effect all of us . they re definitely not more intellectually able than most anyone . yet these people kill the world around us . why does anyone let them
hello all and happy wednesday vicki here to announce our top talent award winner for the show us your shapes challenge . before i get to that , we want to say a big thank you to everyone who participated in the challenge here at our creative corner . there were so many wonderful entries we are so happy you shared your inspiration and creativity with us .
try to see yourself as your parents child . as your parents child you had absolutely no control over their influence on you . do nt move ahead until you have seen this aspect of yourself clearly , no matter how long it takes . you had no power over how you were brought up nor over how you grew up to be who you are now .
that s the first part of our faith . it is , in fact , our part of faith . we must do the believing . our souls are ours , free to respond to god as we wish , and our faith as christians is our choice to respond to god s revelation with belief . faith is saying yes , i believe you to god .
my mother passed away years ago today . i was , and it was horrible for a long time , but it 's ok now . really it is . i will always miss her terribly , but i 'm good . even after something really awful happens , things work out and the universe has a way of righting itself . trust me on this one .
the test lasted four tedious hours . and i stayed on site waiting for her with my and year olds . i was equipped with food and toys to last that long . there was only one other boy there form a private school who promptly informed us that he had been studying and practicing for this test for weeks . thanks kid . we needed that .
this of course is not the case , there is a quality element to it and as i got older , i realised that as long as both parties were satisfied , time did nt matter . if it only takes two minutes for the both of you , than so be it . sexual harmony is far more important with regards to intimacy than anything else .
i pick areas that i want to learn more about . anything on the face of the earth that i am interested in . i limit it to so that i can really focus on learning something and not just gaining information about everything under the sun . i would nt really retain much if i did nt have a purpose and goal in my reading and research
third , learn to live in the present . do not stress over something in the past since you ca nt change it or the future since you are not there yet . what you can control and make better is the present . ensure that is stress free and that you are enjoying quality time , whether at work or at home with your loved ones .
good morning it 's monday you knew that though right you 're probably at work like me , but monday blues ca n't get me down today . i 'm excited because my sister in law and her husband and sweet baby girl are coming to visit us here in greece tomorrow yay i have lots of housework to do , but it 's for a great cause
one thing that always worries me when someone says they have written a ' children 's story ' is that this is such a ' catch all ' that it tells me almost nothing . the first question that comes to mind is who is this story for children require different books at different ages and the books they want are quite different in concept . for example
the little tube along the right hand side is something i picked up in the jewelry bead aisle at my local craft store . cut another strip from the last travel book page and stamp a new word or phrase . roll it up and slide it into the tube , so the word is visible . secure the ends of the tube with small glue dots .
in other crafty news , i 'm not having much luck with the knitting . i know i 'm doing something wrong somewhere , but i do n't quite know what it is . my stitches are too tight on the right hand needle and i 'm not quite sure why i 've put that on hold for awhile whilst i focus on my upcoming drama performance .
i work at a residential treatment center . a place for girls who have been removed from their homes and need therapy and time before they can go back or be adopted . as you can imagine we deal with a lot of anger there . until this morning the worst thing that has happened has been threats , posturing , yelling . that sort of thing .
when we got home i asked john to take the shopping out of the car , he saw the cat food and asked why i had bought it , we do not even own a cat i made an excuse that i picked it up by mistake , instead of dog food . he then tells me we did not need dog food , we needed bird nuts
well these days i pretty much put all my most personal thoughts secrets on the internet anyway so no one would need to when i was a teenager i was much more embarrassed about pretty much everything i was thinking and feeling , now i 'm much more open and honest . i find that the more honest and open i get , the easier life becomes .
this is my life and i do nt get another one , so i m not going to give up the whole damn thing so that someone else can be happy i m not god and i ca nt control human suffering , though in a small way maybe i can influence it . come to think of it , looks like god ca nt control it either
if you look to your left you will see the kitchen area , as well as the living room and the small hallway to the master bedroom . from the kitchen you can get to the laundry area and out the back door to a nice big deck . you can also go into the master bathroom from the laundry area as well as from the bedroom .
now , i am not quite of the older generation , but i am getting close to that stage , so i thought to myself that i really do n't know stories beyond my own grandparents live 's as they related to me . this family tree goes pretty deep and well , it would be a shame to miss out on stories that someone still remembers .
the patterns are quite adaptable but if you wanted to use the same fabric as pictured , you can order kits from modern quilt studio . i love that they 've got step by step illustrated directions . i 'm so visual that i do much better when i can see what i am doing rather than trying to figure it out from a paragraph of directions .
although we continued to check the house on into early december , we could tell the heart had gone out of this garden and indeed its owner did find a new place where she could create her own paradise in a setting with more land and more privacy . these are the last photos i took at sea garden on my last visit there , december , .
fourth thing was that my bond with two of my friends became strong but you know when bond increases there is always someone that gets jealous or feels insecure about it and issues arise , but still strong bond is there and i hope everything gets cleared out soon between everyone . well this fourth thing was about my nice experience and nothing about the learning stuff .
so to anyone who says but i have to vote for what i believe in well , my question is , what do you believe in more do you believe everyone should be forced by law to always do what you think they should do , or do you think that people should be allowed to make their own choices in life , even when they disagree with yours
instead of judging other mamas ' choices , try putting yourself in their shoes . you may not have chosen to do the same , but you realize that they are just doing their best . and for those really hard to crack nuts , those always have to be right types , well all you can do is send them some light and love and move on .
. care if you do nt care about this project or what you re creating or this class , why are you doing it drop the class . do nt waste time and money on something you do nt like . it s disappointing for those of us who want to learn from each other who do care , and have to deal with those who do nt .
either way , over these next few days and weeks i m going to need a lot of self discipline , good time management , and luck . the easter break may just be beginning , but for me its the end of my mini closing of term two week holiday , and the start of a long road of work and perseverance . here s to scene one
my sweet boy somehow managed to turn without my permission . it was met with a great deal of mixed emotion . he was to start a new school district program on his actual birthday . this was finally our chance to move forward with him , and we had and have so many hopes for him . but before we jumped into those waters , we celebrated .
on monday , i spoke of a need for structure in writing a story or novel . when writing about another time period or indeed even in fantasy and science fiction settings , the author needs to consider the infrastructure of their setting and the effects that will have on their characters and stories from the time travel takes , to sensible clothing choices to relevant status symbols .
there 's nothing more to think about . i definitely , definitely love , love , love this one above and beyond the hunger games . it 's no contest really for me . i love this one above and beyond almost all the ya science fiction i 've ever read . and maybe even more than i love most of the adult science fiction i 've read .
obama the fact of the matter is i think if you look at my track record , i 'm raising a family here . when we travel , we got to travel through secret service and air force one , that 's not my choice . i think most folks understand how hard i work and how hard this administration is working on behalf of the american people .
i wanted to go for a nice walk this morning , but doing regular maintenance on my car meant i could nt do that . there was no way i was leaving my car on jack stands to do such a thing . also i could drive to the mall for a walk either . i may still get out this evening after dinner . we shall see .
my lovely sister visited me a couple of weekends ago , and while she was here we decided to make shortcake she 'd made it before , but i 'd never even eaten a real shortcake before . i find that most of the time you see it in a restaurant , grocery store or bakery , it 's actually angel food cake served with strawberries . very different
in my experience when i was feeling very anxious about something or a situation , when i choose to fully embrace and share how i was feeling , the interesting thing was that the anxious feeling changed . in my life i have found that some people have moved away or out of my life and others have moved closer to me as a result of being authentic .
now i know that i showed you some great hallway examples not so long ago , but i could nt resist blogging about this little beauty . taken from one of our upcoming homes in the june issue of beautiful homes on sale rd may do nt miss it , i think it s a great example of how you can make the most of a small space .
my other older sisters were taken by my mom 's parents whom the mother was an alcoholic and i later on learned that her real father had died and had been an artist who would hit my mother with empty beer bottles as a child . again , those are bits and pieces of stories from different parts of my family members at different times of my life .
she hesitated . no i just told you that it was nt a date . she took a sip of her water and ran her fingers through her light brown hair . she eyed him . he d hit a hot button . he gave her a weak smile . we planned to meet for dinner because we needed to discuss some patient cases we were working on .
episode one consists of seven chapters . looking through the trophy list , it s apparent the other four episodes have seven chapters too . it might not sound like much but if episode one is anything to go by , each episode will last roughly two hours . that depends of course on whether or not you re deciding to go through each episode more than once .
as soon as i knew anna was coming into the world i was excited to meet her . i still think i got a good deal with being able to be a stay home dad . just because i enjoyed my single life does not mean i would not be a good parent . just like i do nt have to like all children to love my own .
eating on the run usually means making decisions on the run . take out decisions can be a big diet no no as almost always they are high in calories , high in fat hand high in sodium . all leading causes of weight gain . pack your daily meals and avoid the drive through window convenience foods may not be so convenient when you hit the scale .
also , i 've been shoe shopping a lot lately , and i noticed that if the shoes are just from a random store which does n't sell any well known brands , i do n't like to buy them . it 's quite ridiculous thinking about it , but i think of such nameless shoes as bad quality . i really prefer to wear brand shoes now .
i recently came across something i wrote almost a year ago while living in dc for my final semester of college . though some of the ideas are specific to my time and program in dc , i feel that the larger arguments were worth posting . i was happy to come across this article and be reminded of some of these things . anyways , here she is
its only when of your work is routine , that you must perhaps pro actively give it serious thought of how to initiate a big change in your job or your perception of the current job . time to strongly believe in possibilities which will make you feel truly alive and kicking in your life . its your right to claim that back from life , from yourself .
in the same bowl as to reduce the amount of dirty dishes heat the heavy cream until warm to the touch , but not boiling . or again , use a pot and transfer to the bowl . add in chocolate chips and stir . at first it 'll look like milk chocolate . keep stirring , suddenly it 'll get darker and glossy looking . add vanilla .
prior to my pregnancy , i could do at least push ups with no problem whatsoever , so to go from that to barely being able to do was a major disappointment . when i did my trial , i was able to do good form push ups before i felt like i was going to die . and , you know what i m ok with that .
in other words , if you want to reduce stress and possibly improve your time management , your to do list should be super short . in fact it should include only the most important three things you need to do each day when they are crossed off , feel free to do a little smug dance round the office and then start a new one . okay .
i bought some cool flowers to put in our front yard where we dug out a big bush last season , but have been so lazy and not wanted to go out and plant them yet . which i am so happy that i did nt because it snowed today and will continue to do so all weekend . so moral of the story , being lazy pays off
the potatoes are in , the early tomatoes are tucked away under their tunnel , and i started dozens of squash plants this week i try to start them on may st every year . we 've had a cooler than normal spring , so hopefully it 's not going to prove too early this year . fingers crossed that the weather warms up in the next few weeks
when i started this blog about the quiet west coast of south africa , i thought that i would really have to hunt for stories to tell and paint . i knew that i would sometimes have to squeeze a story out of a rock yet , so many things just happen . and here we have a shark in the bay a very short walk from my home
okay , it has been some time , too long time , but the studies and work have simply been too big a bite for me to also write on a regular basis . at least for now . i m not giving up though , and now i found something interesting enough , that i really wanted to share it with all of my readers out there .
it is important that we continually encourage our faith . choose a way you ll grow in your faith this week write a letter to jesus , telling him any doubts you have about him talk to a christian friend about what you believe in jesus share about your faith with a non christian friend . for extra impact , invite him or her to church next week .
so that 's today 's news . i 'll process it tonight and come back tomorrow and research the hell out of the rental market and find the best rental ever and everything will fall into place on a path that will end up giving us the best house ever , etc . a few extra months down the road . until then , look at my baby boy
most people say ' i ca n't imagine doing that . ' trust me . while it is not an easy thing to do , it is easier than you might think , and when you read what i am about to tell you , it might just make you think twice before you pull into the drive through if you are having any issues with your health .
each year , there are new trends that come out for watches . there are many people who love to learn these trends so they can stay on top of the fashion changes . whether it s for work or simply for the love of fashion and accessories , getting at least one of the few tends for watches will immediately show a stylish up to date look .
the truth is , my life is less busy now than it was when my three boys were also playing sports . yet , i did lots of writing during those years . i do n't have less time now , i 'm not using it as wisely . they say the first step to recovery is knowing you have a problem . so where has my time gone
i came across a shirt yesterday . a man s dress shirt , fine white cotton , athletic cut , french cuffs , beautifully made . it was david s favorite shirt , it fit him well . it showed his wide shoulders , long body , and small waist to best advantage . he looked damn good in it . nobody else could ever wear that shirt .
i did n't say anything , though . i just kept looking for my stuff , and ignored her skinny ass . i wish i had turned around and said , excuse me but i did n't . i was more in the mood to just get on with my evening , and not call out some rude ass skinny bitch on her fucking issues with my size .
i ll be presenting a couple of times over the next few days but the one i enjoy the most is when i get to talk and share with other social studies teachers . great conversations always break out about content and instructional strategies . this year i m focusing on how st century skills , the common core , and technology can engage kids and improve learning .
i 've been here longer than i made it both those other times combined . and i just got the key to my own place . it 's a tiny little apartment , but it 's exactly what i need right now . it 's a scary terrifying new adventure , but i 'm feeling more capable than i ever have in my life . i can do this .
i recently went and visited my parents for the easter break . it was great to escape the big city for the slower pace of the seaside town where they live . it s just a pity that half of sydney seemed to have a similar idea . but i was able to use my time away to do some reading five hour bus trips were made for this .
and now john has begun his final and perhaps most meaningful transformation . through the purifying fire of his illness john s shining spirit has emerged . he has left us with a lasting lesson which we can keep . live your life with courage , and though you are afraid , never never fail to take that next step forward . you may be surprised where it leads .
however , there are two things i tell clients first , that the word innovation has taken on numerous dimensions that maybe did not fully exist prior to this digital age . a company can be considered innovative if it manages to find a new revenue stream or new use for an existing product it does not have to come up with a new product or service each time .
. task rabbit have spare time on your hands this website has many jobs posted from people who do nt have any extra time to do the simple things that you and i do laundry , grocery shopping , and picking up the dry cleaning . this is a fairly new site , and they are only serving certain us cities . but check back in , they are expanding
the novel 's real strength , however , was gill james 's interesting take on the future . i ca n't place my finger on what felt new , but i enjoyed it , and i wish we could have spent more time exploring instead of developing emotionally . the book got better as it went on , and i 'd certainly pick up book two in the series .
i used to like this beer a lot more than i do now . i drank it first in college when i was trying to get away from the regular american light beers . i really would n't recommend this beer to anyone if you asked me for a pale ale . i just do n't think that england has figured out the pale ales like the americans have .
these three statements are true . every single person should be proud of themselves and what they have accomplished . every person should be happy and hold his or her head high , for life is not easy , and making it this far is an accomplishment . all should all be able to look at themselves in the mirror and say i love myself and i am wonderful .
but i would say we have lived above our dear downstairs neighbours for nearly years now , and kept them dry . that includes the birth , brief life , and death of helen and david s son oliver , who had down s syndrome and was born and died here in edinburgh . been there , done that , when it comes to keeping neighbours dry through pain .
not letting myself get hungry throughout the day helped with not throwing up after every meal . i got sick more if i ate on a empty stomach . the best thing for me to eat was dried fruit . i tried fresh fruit and as much as i love it , it did n't make me feel like i ate anything but for some reason dried fruit did .
occasionally when i m performing , someone with a dream of their own will pull me aside and tell me that they wish they could do what i do . the catch is that they say they could never sing in front of people . when this happens , all i do is give them a big smile and say , i used to say the same thing myself .
i hate the loss of time as i literally teach to the test . isabelle has an amazing math brain with a highly respected curriculum . the girl has a average for the year but we are having to take hours a day to help make certain she can do the math which will appear on her test . and all i can think as we do this is why
the march challenge is to draw a sheep . yep , drawing . i ca n't tell you how many times i 've had people tell me how they wish they could draw , but just ca n't . i did n't think i could draw either and there 's a ton of room for improvement for sure but one day i just decided to give it a try .
so , here is a list of specific items that i would like them to contain . if you wish to make a certain item let me know and i will make sure that we wo n't end up with to many of one item and to few of another . if you think of something else that could be useful that is not on this list let me know
goals . if i do nt set some sort of goal , i ll end up wandering on the internet or staring off into space . a large project usually means a word count goal , while smaller projects could be something as little as finding one right word . the idea is to create a reachable goal that matches to scope and size of my current writing project .
despite knowing what holds me back from the kind of love and partnership i want , i find myself unable to make the changes that would allow this . at least not fast enough . and the irony is that these very issues are the ones my last potential partner could least deal with because of his issues , which in turn were the last i could deal with .
it is a very good example of one of the problems in modern america . people decide everyone else 's business is theirs and think if they make enough noise they will get their way , even when it is not their tax money at stake , their job , their community , their state . at least ninety percent have not read whatever legislation is on the board .
it is incredible to realize you have lived before and will live again . there is always wonder that such a thing is possible . knowledge of past lives has given me much greater respect for life and for my own actions . you do not need to remember your past lives to progress , but you do need to make the most of your time here on earth .
travis and i going to together for adoption boot camp . we are going to walk in with huge eyes and open hearts to learn more about our adoption as children of god and why it 's so important to be sure our foundation is always solid and we just love all things together for adoption so , we are also saving up for the together for adoption national conference
you see , this summer i was busy , but only working one job as i figured out my plan for this next semester . then , out of the blue , i got an offer . a school that i had subbed at last spring called me on july nd to see if i could take on a long term sub position for the new sixth grade class .
i very rarely am motivated to do anything beyond my small circle , but i will be sending this post to my member of parliament asking him to start a meaningful conversation on how we can make sure no child grows up with the pain and fear and confusion of being unloved . to me , that is a conversation i would be willing to spend my tax dollars on .
may st there are still several kids who need sponsored so that they can go to camp this summer can you please consider donating towards that or at least pray for generous hearts to give to these kids i m not sure what the current number is , but there are still well over kids who need sponsored , last i knew . perhaps closer to . can you please help
during times with the lord , my prayer on a consistent basis is lord , do nt let this ugly thing creep up in my heart and life . sometimes as christians it can be there and we do nt even realize it . we have to come to the place where we do nt mind saying and living , i m nothing lord , it s all about you .
holly 's challenge was to make a simple card design so multiple cards could be easily and quickly made to make a gift set of cards . we only had these four entries . i guess with christmas crafting , shopping , and other holiday things going on , the guys and gals at the forum just could n't squeeze another thing in . we sure had some gorgeous entries .
we ended up working with a team of people to plan it over several months and it finally pulled it off on the sunday before thanksgiving . we were stoked , because in the end , it was a huge hit . we had over families show up , worship together and then engage in meeting the needs of someone less fortunate either in our community or around the world .
is bore your reader . after i finished the first draft of my novel i went back and read it , and guess what one of the main characters completely bored me . at that point i had a decision to make . go with what i had written and try to find some other way to punch up the character or completely rework the character and thus the story .
one morning this past august i woke up and felt like i had literally been hit by a semi truck while i was sleeping . i ached all over . it hurt to move . and i thought to myself what the hell did i do yesterday i could n't remember doing anything particularly out of the ordinary . so i thought maybe i had some sort of a virus .
answer these however you wish , with the first thing that comes to mind please feel free to be honest here , even if you think what you have to say is n't necessarily what i hope to hear . my hope is just simply to start a conversation about how people both in and out of the church view christianity and christians ... because i think it 's important .
use it as an opportunity to learn about what s most important to your business consider causes that best match your company culture , and ask your employees about the causes that matter to them . if you ca nt see and easily explain the connection between your brand and your charity , consumers wo nt buy it pun intended , and it s unlikely the effort will sustain commitment .
i can also get down to showing you all the little bits of crafting that have slipped through my studying net . i knew i had no time to work on items for pretty green so everything i made was for yours truly . ironically this means that despite being really busy , i have actually made more things for myself this last month than in the last couple of years
after this morning s work , i met up with my acting friend and co producer of the sydney fringe festival show we are hoping to get up in september . it was great chatting with him about acting , agents and everything we need to get done in order to get this show up argh we still have a lot to do to get everything together in under only months
in the last few days i have been reminded about god 's love for me , and what it means to be a good father . of course , wanting to be like the ultimate father , we , fathers have shoes that we will never be able to fill . we can , however , take every day occurrences and use them as opportunities to show what god reveals .
one of the concerns i have today is that i think those of us who seek and follow after god can focus too much on jesus and me and forget about jesus and we . yes , our faith is a personal commitment but , as i look back on those moments when my faith was truly deepened , most all of those moments have been in a corporate setting .
as i thought about this saying , i searched for the positive . finally it hit me ... maybe that saying is not true after all . maybe god does give us more than we can handle . maybe we are given more than we can individually handle so that we are given the opportunity to lean on others . in this thinking i came up with my new belief .
a subject has to meet several criteria . first , it has to be someone with whom i want to spend a lot of time , someone whose work interests me and has had a significant cultural impact . second , there has to be sufficient source material . third , and perhaps most importantly , i have to be able to find an angle that will interest young readers .
so today i am giving you all a little update to how this project pan has been going along . first , i would like to say that it is taking me longer then i thought and to be honest i thought that i would be at least half way throw , but i am not . so far i have just finished products which it s not so bad .
tonight i needed a good run to beat me up and get rid of the stress of the day . i played hockey last night so i was a little stiff and sore . my back hurts the most after a night of hockey . so after running the trails in the local park on tuesday and playing hockey last night my body was nt really ready to start running .
today was a run around town , which felt great i did or so miles . it 's a beautiful fall day in new england so it was quite nice . will most likely run some more tomorrow and get in some yoga ... it 's time to get back to what i thought was going to turn into a weekly yoga habit . must do it for real this time
last post i mentioned a plan b we were considering . well scratch plan b it just does nt seem to be the way for us for the time being . so , now we are moving on to an alternative plan b which i will not go into detail about at this writing . let s just say , it would involve putting on our sea legs so to speak
the god of small things is highly acclaimed , and i m not so dense as to be unable to see why . i appreciate that many , many people love the prose and i can understand how the plot might keep one engaged . the characters are interesting , i guess . and certainly it s well written in my opinion over written , but more on that below .
that being said , sometimes the rooms are n't so great . which is what i thought about last night 's episode . ugh . the challenge last night was to use items from a salvage yard . i thought this would be my favorite episode in the series but it just turned out to be kind of boring . so let 's take a look at the four rooms .
i have missed you my friends . my life took on some crazy twists and turns this last while . i had written some time ago about my friend who was diagnosed with cancer and i am happy to report the transplant went well and things are looking like they may just turn out alright . i have prayed every day and it seems as though it was not wasted .
i post about the funny and silly stuff that people think is an emergency when it is n't . for example , when they call because they picked up a dead dog and do n't know what to do . the dog is dead and not a person and no center can help with that . most other people would agree they would leave the dead dog on the road .
but i can tell you what i think are their best songs . the order is not an accurate . the no . song might not be better than the no . song . surely , though , the favorites of my favorites will tend to be in the lower numbers . i assume the ones that will first come to mind are those that mean the most to me .
seriously , dear readers , this is not the end . i just need a short break . there 's a lot of stuff up in the air right now that i ca n't share with you , as much as i 'd like to . i suspect that in another month or two things will be more settled and i can start writing again . just not right now .
now , the yard sale which i will write about later took care of the crap in the living room , the kitchen is clean and free of almost all fruit flies , the fridge is in and working great . i was finally able to make dinner in my kitchen without having to scrounge for counter space . i have my house back and i feel so much better .
a whole year ago . a friend of mine told me recently she has nt really felt the recession in the u.s. after i gave her a very cold look , i told her she was lucky , ever so lucky . i got lucky to find a job , and even though it may drive me crazy every other day , i am truly lucky to have my job .
finally i came back inside after enjoying my cigarette and i went to bed or tried to anyways . i had a lot on my mind . so much had happened and i was pretty sure this was only the beginning . i did nt know what the future held for me . it had definitely been a long day one which i was extremely glad was over i slept .
usually , my girl is very matter of fact about these things , but this time , she cried . she yelled at the catbird . and then she convinced herself that perhaps that was n't late rose at all , it was some other butterfly who just happened to be there , some other butterfly that she had n't raised . whatever helps you sleep at night , kid .
when i got home from the meeting , i found out that our refrigerator had died but not before giving handsome cause for concern over some serious smoke smells . lucky someone was home because it was getting worse until he finally shut down the electricity to it . looks like we 're in for a change . i 'll tell you all about it soon . i hate that fridge
i seriously went to the grocery store and got all the ingredients in less than minutes . now that 's a record for me i walked into the store and headed straight to the produce section . i found the tomatoes and sorted through them until i found eight beautifully shaped tomatoes . i split them into two bags to make sure they would n't get squished along the way .
i have never given this topic a thought that who would be my favourite character in harry potter books besides harry himself . let me see what will be the result by the end of this post . i am excluding harry here because he seems to be the favourite by default and it would be difficult to compare and select somebody else if he is also in the competition .
i feel lucky . blessed to be part of such an amazing group of woman , i know they all care so deeply about one another and me . proud to know that shannon is feeling the love during the terrible time . this group of woman is so amazing and they know how to come together when ever anyone is in need and shannon deserves nothing less right now .
i think part of what i have come to realise is that i can achieve anything on my own i have to , there is no one else to pick up the pieces but that sometimes i need someone else just to be on my side , to give me a hug , tell me its all ok , and to tell me i look amazing even when i do nt .
when it comes to our children , often our fears are based on something that might happen in the future . the future that is so far away we have no idea what it will look like , a future that is ultimately beyond our control . our fears are based on something that might happen in our children 's future , did you notice , it 's not your future .
today i want to slip back in time to when i first started this blog . there are a few posts that i 'd like to share that i 'm pretty sure i posted before anyone even knew i had a blog . i still feel like some of my original posts have been my best . i had so many more issues floating around in my brain in those days .
a few years ago my boss had our volunteer services team read a book called the five love languages by gary chapman . at first i was a little confused about why in the world she would ask us to read this book for work . but it did nt take me very long to figure out the benefit of this book in my work , and also in my home .
these people work along the south of england but there are others all over the country who deserve your support and thanks for the ceaseless support they give people . we the family are hoping to be at the annual dinner this year . when we have attended in the past it has been fun and friendly . we have always been , as has everyone else , made very welcome .
i 'd like to spend some time at a bar with this , three notches , and the sam adams belgian session on tap , and play some cards , and talk some politics , and watch some baseball . i feel that day may not be so far away anymore . maybe i was wrong about last year being the year of session beer . maybe it 's this year .
how is your day lining up are you in the game of life running around and trying to find the ball when all the time the lord is saying , hey , i have it right here in my hand . come and get it you run right by him and and pray , god , why ca nt i find that ball am i the only one who has done this
with similar frustration , dave has been looking for an apartment to rent in paris . not just for a week , but a year long contract . he found one he really wants . but the agent just ca n't be bothered . he calls her , leaves messages , has gone to the office , gotten promises from her that she will call him back and again , nothing .
which gets me to the good news i happened to stop by for a retail visit three days before the doors would close forever . while that meant i 'd missed most of the goodies probably better for my post christmas wallet , i scooped up a few treasures at the crazy price of each . this stretch velvet dress by sandwich was one such bargain regularly priced at something around .
but , then i heard the first single off the new album strange clouds , and it made me start to think even more it was one of those songs where i did nt hate it , but i did nt like it either so i was stuck midway . after hearing so good i started to learn towards the album being a positive release let s see if i m right
i started off with a page , then two , then five . more conversations . then an invitation to present my ideas at a brown bag at the global fund for women . i was shocked that the room was packed and that s when i knew i was on to something . over lunch after the presentation my friend natalie convinced me to hurry up and write a book .
when i got to the man i colored the smaller side first and quickly so the other side would n't dry . then i quickly came back and finished the rest of the picture . i was n't too careful about the water line , since i knew that the water was going to be blue anyways , but i tried to stay out of the grass as much as possible .
continuing , some fans have said they ve gotten the strength to live watching our show and even said it was the joy of their lives , i want to thank these fans and i want to let them know i respect them . we are not great people who can make people feel such way , so i think those who ve felt that way were people with warm hearts .
i think this is going to be a new thing . i think i 'm going to put together a list of a few things that seem like they 're important enough that everyone should know and conduct a very non scientific poll of what people really know about the economy and the state of things . this is either going to be very interesting or very depressing . or both .
i know this is n't an original idea but almost all the lists i found had holiday activities included , and i wanted one that was just for winter . so , here you go . simply click on the image below and save it to your computer to print . it looks great up to an x , but i printed mine as a x to fit on the clipboard .
sadly , we say goodbye to our wonderful dt buddy jackie , who is taking some time out to try some new things , she 's going to be hugely missed by all her dt buddies , but she knows there will always be a team position here for her if she feels like coming back at any time . wishing you all the very best jackie , and thank you xxx
in the end i know that god has each of us in the palm of his hands and he will not give us more than we can handle . still , i am guilty to say that i catch myself saying why . find myself crying this weekend because christmas was my favorite time of year , and now i feel as though i am struggling to just keep it together .
that was the norm . sometimes , however , he 'd dump us and go off to town too , and mum did n't really ever come as there was always friction , going right back to the days when she was n't considered good enough for my father because a she was a catholic and b she 'd been engaged before . the horror the tension never really left us .
i did a post called , some of the reason 's why we bought this house , back in january . it was about the bridge in our backyard , and the indoor pool we have . i want to show you some of the changes that we have made to the pool room and some of the beautiful pictures of how the bridge has looked over the last few weeks .
time has shown that those who achieve the most success in the present are those who , in the past , were considered to be ahead of the times . the curse of a failed future is reserved for those who fall behind the times . so , the question of the day is when was the last time the life insurance industry has been described as being ahead of the times
in other news , i ve decided to give cent store produce a try . the decision was based on two things your comments on yesterday s post , and the fact that to get to my spin class this morning , i drove past three different cent stores . i took it as a sign . let s take a tour of the cent stores in my area , shall we
can you stand it i know we ca n't we know we have n't given you some new images to play with in a bit , so it 's about time do n't forget , our rubber closeout is still going strong . some stamps have sold out and we are removing them from the site as quickly as we can to make for an easier shopping experience for you . d
eight years ago , i gave birth to my first daughter . she was greatly anticipated well before her arrival . you see , when i met my husband michael , he was already the father to a little boy . then , we got married and had another boy two months later you do the math i was a pregnant bride . and another . and another . and another .
my time was winding down at nd , and in the spring before would eventually graduate i left in the fall and graduated the follow may , the opportunity presented itself . at the time , my daughter was about nine months old , and i would go home for two hours at lunch to watch her until my wife came home from teaching latin at the local catholic high school .
ok funny facts i did study for surgery . the only thing that i could control was staying awake for the hours . it would help them remove the tumor more safely . my dad said the first thing i said in recovery was i tried so hard dad to awake and he responded , i did . i stay awake the entire time with a few entertaining comments to everyone .
. sitting staring out of the window at clouds and seeing shapes in them . i was once staring out of a train and thought ' how come i 've never seen a cloud shaped like a heart ' . just then , i noticed a cloud shaped like a heart . i 've stopped wishing stuff like that since then because am convinced am a witch and have special powers .
there 's nothing wrong with tooting your own horn to get attention . if you do n't have a press agent and really , who of you does then it 's going to be mostly up to you to draw attention to whatever it is that you are doing . do n't look at self promotion as something negative . it 's the most common start on the road to success .
well i was nt physically robbed , just emotionally but i ll get into that later . oh my hell , i only have more class days left . i also have an advanced baking competition and a final for that and a portfolio due . that s it . wow , i knew i d finally get here but it s getting so exciting now that i can see the end .
i know we all need shoes , but who does n't just love shoes i mean really , such an incredible way to make a fashion statement , am i right or am i right dog 's are a man 's best friend , shoes are a girls and shoes are also a huge investment . and to ensure they look great from day to day , keeping them organized is extremely important
is n't summer great my summer has been filled with a lot of painting and a lot of lunch dates with friends . today began with a few hours of painting , then a hour lunch with a long lost friend . later this week i am joining some very special blogging buddies for lunch , two i have already had the pleasure of meeting and two i look forward to meeting .
one of my struggling students came up to me with her journal and so proudly said , can i read my story to you . i love to read and write . it makes it all worth it when they say things like that to you because you know that you have planted a seed in the child that will always be with them and be the driving force to their success .
life is this beautiful wonderful journey , and although everything tells us that we should be in high flying corporate positions and married with two kids by , we really do nt have to . although the media says that we have to be in committed relationships to enjoy christmas and valentine s day , would nt it be better to be in a relationship with someone who really is worth committing to
the march glymm box was initially disappointing , but i thought better of half of the products after some use . so far , the april glymm box is not overly impressive we ll see how it goes after i try some of these out . may may just be my last glymm box , if i do nt feel better about this box and the next one does nt wow me .
i love this stuff , also have a jelly roll of it in my stash . i have to leave this home next week or i will once again end up with a dozen things going at once . i am thinking this would make a nice father 's day quilt for hubby as well as look pretty cute in the family room any reason to make another quilt works for me .
today 's card is in memory of my mom , she 's been gone eleven years now today is her birthday and her favorite color was red . she would have been years old , i never got to share my card making with her . she did teach me to sew when i was a little girl though , we spent hours and hours together lost in fabric and patterns good memories
i learned to set phone boundaries from being a music teacher in my home . if the phone rings during a music lesson , i do n't take the call . although i am at home , i am working . the student has paid for minutes , and it is my job to be honest and give them that time . i show myself the same respect when i am writing .
across the room . all of that . well , actually i need to condense it yet more into just two shelf units currently three to make room for my foot work table and some breathing space . one of the units will sit over that darn steam thing , which cuts down on my storage even more but this will work i had nt truly finished organizing those shelves yet anyway .
the hardest part is being away from those i love . i am in the middle of the country literally thousands of miles from anyone i love and sometimes i ca n't help but wonder if it 's really worth it . honestly , i 'm still not sure . but this is what i 've got myself into , so i might as well savor it while i 've got it .
i 'll be checking in with you guys too . i have my gear all packed now and spent the day quietly making last minute preparations . tomorrow with only a few hours of sleep if i 'm lucky i 'll start out on my cross country , cross ocean hour journey . my pockets will be full of all my loved ones , that 's you right up near my heart .
step clean up . as i said this process is quite messy . one tip i can give is to use the glitter tray martha sells . i promise you she is not paying me to say this , but i bought them , and was happy to find that they have a little channel in one corner so you can pour the glitter back into the jars . how cool is that
i showed the second concept to my group and professor and everyone loved it but there was a problem . the concepts were created in the beginning of the semester and after several class sessions , my group and i had learned more about all of the aspects of a good ad campaign . with that said , we came together and decided on a new campaign idea using this new knowledge .
i sat down with her and said ' if i see school slipping , that 's not going to work . you 're going to stop until you 're out of school , ' he said . last year she had her best year ever , so i encourage it . i think it builds a lot of character in a young person so i have no problem with them starting early .
each basket has a number , and specific activity or game inside . i change these up frequently . i usually will have at least five baskets with a game centered around the specific skill we are going over . i keep the others with a review skill in them . right now we have addition , fact families , and odd even numbers . just to keep my babies on their toes
so who is my routine workout buddy during times like now when i have lots of finals , it s my study guides this afternoon i had a test at in my , ironically enough , health benefits of exercise class . so i headed to the gym with my study guide in hand and sweat it out on the arc trainer for minutes while reading over my study guide non stop .
each week we are apparently going to reduce our product by one more , and add in replacement foods , until we are off product and eating approximately calories . although i think if you really want to , you can continue to order and eat a few products but do nt think that will be me . it will be so weird grocery shopping again , and preparing food and eating it
happily for me , this exercise is , in a way , second nature . but the one thing i did nt want to do was use cars as the example . it took a few days to come up with something that would allow me to do the same technique . but at am wednesday morning , it hit me . something so simple i almost did nt think of it .
i shook my head . she knew i was n't satisfied with that answer . then she looked directly into my eyes and said , jeff , it 's me . i know you trust me , you always have , and you have to trust me now . there was no other way . through katie , you will understand . her future will guide you to the answers you need .
the message to boys eh , you could take this from the peter pan pedophile view or the brother s view , either way , if you take the girl you have to take the brothers as well , either to keep people off your trail or to protect your sister , who is nt smart enough to go alone and she takes care of you , like a mother , anyway .
poor body image is directly related to self hatred . i hate myself so i also hate my body . women who have been abused spend lots of time trying to hide their bodies , the idea being , if i can become ugly or invisible no one will try to take advantage . this outward need to become hidden is sad but when this is broken it is beautiful to watch .
to start out i need to say that this card was inspired by one i saw on scs and you can check it out here . as soon as i saw this card i knew exactly how i would make my card . i just love how much inspiration is out there , even if you do n't have the same stamp sets things can be changed up and made your own .
it begun in august . gino had just broken up , and was lonely for friends . he barely kept in touch with people during the time he had a relationship and as a result , most of his friends abandoned him . we had known each other for a couple of years , he would call me once in a while to catch up but we were never really particularly close .
this is a small portrait of my dad painted in oils on a canvas board . its going to be a gift for him as he has just started drawing again at the grand age of which just goes to prove its never too late i remember him drawing people and faces when i was just a kid so it makes me so happy to see him finally pick up the pencil again
seriously , what am i going to do it was my sarcasm tune up for the day . it made me ready for my fourth grade students . and all that will change . i will probably become a very boring teacher now . i wo nt be able to roll my eyes effectively when i get a strange answer from them . seriously , what the hell am i going to do
by this all men will know that you are my disciples , if you love one another . john , niv loving others means that we will be patient , kind , and humble . whether we are standing in line at the grocery store , stuck in a long line of traffic or doing dishes at the kitchen sink our attitude is setting the stage for their future . choose well .
speaking of kicking the bucket , charlie did that in , which means that the turn me over series was pretty much the last thing he published . as bad as it is if you can make out the drawings both ways on all of these , you 're doing at least better than me , i guess we must forgive him since he was pushing and maybe not feeling too great .
i hope this made sense to you . i know this tutorial is long , and if you are reading this , than i thank you for reading the whole thing if i over explained things , it was because i tried to make it easy even if you know very little about sewing . i would love to know if you tried to make this , and if you enjoyed my tutorial
yesterday , my boyfriend and i celebrated being together for years it 's so hard to believe that it has already been that long every moment of the past years has been a learning experience for the both of us . i would not trade him for anyone in the world . we definitely belong together and the best thing is that no one can break the bond that he and i have created
mason s nine and he s pretty mature for his age . he tells me a lot of kids say a lot of nasty things on the bus , but he does nt resort to their level of thinking and stands up for himself and his buddies . that s what we taught him . still , i wonder just how many things he is learning on his bus ride home from school .
it was the first project i made from the book but i can see it 's going to be a favourite for baby gifts . a lot of the projects are on the ' weird cute ' side and i was slightly worried that the result might be ' frankenstein 's cat ' , but i think he 's turned out well . it 's also quicker than knitting a toy from scratch .
i 've considered being a teacher . but i really do n't know what i 'd teach i 'm not passionate enough about english or social studies or math to teach only that every day . with social work , i can teach something different every day , something essential , life skills and things some kids do n't get taught at school or at home . i will also be learning myself .
greetings , kids . snack foods have come up twice this morning , thus inspiring this list . now , bear in mind , as with all my lists , these are n't necessarily top five or only five . just five of what could be many . so please , by all means , add your picks to the list every week . it just may inspire a follow up down the road
to date , i 've just been watching , feeding , handling , and waiting . not handling the babies mind you not til they come out of the cage . one breeder told me that they handle the babies at days and ' open the eyes ' not sure why that is as i have not seen it in any of the books . i 'll let you know what i find .
but then i entered high school and began to be friends with people who did nt live the right life at all . in fact , they did nt even care about what the bible said i did nt know how to have conversations with people who did nt honor the word of god as perfect and authoritative . for the first time , i was nt ending the conversation . they were .
i am working really hard to squeeze in a little time here and there for baking , even when that means that i have to sacrifice my sleep time , but it 's worth it in fact , i made some cake last week , which took me no less than two weeks to finish , but anything is better than nothing . will post that one up soon . have a blessed week
is there any day of the year that is better than the first day of spring the sun is shining , the birds are chirping , the flowers are beginning to bloom , and you can even see the leaves trying their hardest to make their big debut . i 'd love to write more , but a bike ride and a picnic in the park seems to be calling all of our names
it took some time but eventually it came out . it was a battle anger , guilt and love . and they went in that order . if i do nt love someone , it s impossible for me to feel guilty about being angry . and i was real angry . there was a lot less guilt though , there was no doubt that my anger was justified which i think helped .
when you purchase the participating products , they will give you a code on your receipt . after you sign up for the program , which began april st and goes thru july st , you will enter your code online or you can even text it with your cell phone . all it takes is points to start earning prizes . the more points you get , the better prize you earn .
one week ago , i was sitting at a dining room table waiting for my shift to start . the manager was walking toward the door and handed me the cordless phone as he passed . this was strange because i am but a humble drive through guy . what possible phone call could would i be better suited to handle than the manager , especially when i had nt even started work yet
on the other side , i have this memory of my own mother . she would always say , i do n't want to be treated like a queen for a day . what she wanted was a daily call to check in , even when i was an adult , married with children ... you know . yet my mother and i did n't get along well enough for that to happen .
why would i want to increase the earning ability of someone who has nt said two words to me in years part of me wanted to tell her immediately that if she wants me on her team , she needs to invest some time into learning about me and then call me again in months . if she can pass my tell me about my life test , then i will sign up .
this was our first year farming , and the learning curve was steeper than you can imagine . it was at the same time . when we took the leap into farming , overnight we became responsible for several hundred tiny little lives , and the weight of that responsibility was heavy . no matter what , our days were filled with hard work , and now the thought of anything being damaged and
in your post , include what wine you open , why you picked that wine to wash away your bad day , and the price or suggested retail price of the wine . there are no restrictions on price , country , varietal , etc . the sky is the limit . you just need to give us all the details so we can find the wine for after our own bad day .
anyway who should it be on my mobile but one of these people . so we have a little conversation , in which she says i m feeling very lonely at the moment . how about i come visit you some time from another city and i say that s a lovely suggestion but i m really busy right now maybe we could just email for now and i ring off and think ,
someone else came up with this idea so all credit to them and none to me , but this is an idea that struck my fancy . if you get all three options wa and your war assets are high enough say around then a fourth option should pop up an option to refuse . from there you can watch as all the work you did either pays off or falls to pieces .
retirement should be a time where you get to experience everything you did nt have time to do while you were working therefore , it is never too early to start planning and taking action . once you formulate your plan with the help of the best retirement planning software , do nt delay take caution today , and you will be well on your way to achieving the retirement of your dreams .
over the past few months i have found myself changing my expectations for many people around me my clients , my vendors , my friends , my kids , my spouse , my siblings . i think we have some expectations ground into us when we are young , from what our parents taught us . then life experiences , a recession , and watching others around us moderates our long term thoughts .
let me know if you anything looks weird , or if i should change anything i noticed i may have made the pieces too big or the top pieces do nt look high enough i probably wo nt change it though , as i ve already covered it and almost finished it . i do know that there is a diamond shape missing on the nose of the head . it will be added
i know , my dear , that you dream of a day when all men will live in harmony and peace . that day is drawing near . how soon , is up to all of you . there is no time to waste . accept that you can do this . it would not have been asked of you , otherwise . let all that you do , be done with love .
each day begins with a scripture to read and then takes that and forms a truth from god 's word . a relevant story for that scripture for the boys is followed by a triple dog dare ways the boy can take action and have a hands on experience from what he has read . mission accomplished gives the boys a place to journal what they learned , and did for that day .
an hour away from home , the lights on the car went out . it was in the morning , and nobody was on the road . the car just died right there on the interstate like a little bitch . andy tried to figure out what was wrong with it , but considering we were at least a few miles from a gas station , there was n't much we could do .
we all feel at times that what we wish for is beyond our reach , but if you keep striving towards your goal , it s more than possible that you ll get there one day . sometimes the only thing needed to make the impossible dream come true , is patience . often , we give up too soon , and maybe , just before our dream was about to be realized .
after the show , we walked around the complex . there is a howl at the moon in there and a dance club called whiskey river . we felt like we were in college again just being there . my boots , while pretty comfy , were not made for dancing so we did n't hit up the club . but we want to go back sometime . anybody up for visiting and dancing
so , i posted this , and then there s nothing there not a single word of what i had written i sat here , staring at the screen , wondering which easter bunny ate all my words and where did the effing link go now i have to go and find it again . so this will be a shorter frustrated post , because of the easter bunny eating all my words .
so i 've got to put this chapter of my life behind me . no more reading up on baby gear from now on i 'll read about strollers as part of social commentary , not for just how awesome and life changing the features might be . and i 'll take every opportunity i have to hold someone else 's baby , just to be close to that kind of sweetness again .
oh . this is n't a bible teaching by the way , so you are n't going to see a bunch of scripture passages . mostly because i do n't all of them off the top of my head , and this is a blog , and so i am just writing free form with whatever come into my head . sort of like a journal except all of you can read it .
maybe you re out shopping , on a train , or just going to a gathering at church . please do nt isolate yourself from those around you . take the time to encourage someone , even if you just flash them a friendly smile as you pass by . you never know the good you might do just by stepping out of your own little world and engaging in someone else s .
hi everyone . a bit late with posting my contribution to scrapbook sisters latest card challenge distress , but as the saying goes better late than never . i m still suffering with the cold of all colds courtesy of my son and i do nt seem to be able to get into anything at the moment . its typical a bit of time off with easter and this bank holiday and not well
we will again be reminded of why we do something so crazy as growing our own food . the more i see on the news about our food , the more i am glad that i am able to grow even a small portion of what we eat . i can be a part of the history of our world , by growing and eating foods that have been nurtured for thousands of years .
though , for anybody utilizing online dating , they need to think twice about assembly up with somebody they do not know except they feel comfy with them . it s going to be so vital to take the time to know who someone is chatting with first before any dates are made , even whether it is just friendship somebody is wanting for . wait till each events are prepared to satisfy up .
first off , sorry to everyone who has emailed or commented here lately . my week was beyond crazy so i did n't have a lot of time for blogging . i 've also become addicted to a new tv show that i 've been trying to pull myself away from . did anyone else see the new revenge episode wednesday night where we finally got to see who was shot at the white party
i think the worst part in all of this , is literally no one understands why i feel this way . lora , you 'll love it lora , this will be so good for him . yeah , i get that . i also get that my one and only purpose for living is now going to be gone all day and i have no idea what the hell to do with myself .
i 've had a pretty rough years , but is going to be different . i have n't felt that the last two years . i think i even faked it a time or two and tried to make other people believe that . this year i believe it . i 'm a star trek next generation fan , so my next statement will only sound stupid if you do n't watch that show .
so i guess what i learned this morning was that criticism pops up everywhere in life , and that learning how to use it is valuable whether you own a restaurant or write a book . or maybe i already knew this . but until today , i had never so clearly seen the parallel . we writers are n't so unique in our struggles after all which is kind of a nice thought .
it 's kind of nice to know that a little boy is coming so all those cute boy things i searched for kaelen to wear and use , his little brother can use . i will still have to get him a few things because the seasons are off from when kaelen would have been born and i get to start the hunt for the perfect coming home outfit again so that 's fun .
yes , if you do n't change things now then you will have a good life . you 'll get to travel the world a little bit , you 'll have a home of your own , a wife and a son . but you will not be true to yourself or to anyone else . you 'll spend a long time being who others think you should be and not who you are .
when i decided i was emo , i did nt even know what emo was . i d read somewhere that a genuine emo is one who lives the life of an emo without even knowing what an emo is . this sounds confusing because you have to be an emo to understand emo . and yet for all your innocence about things emo , you re actually living the genuine emo lifestyle . see
honestly , it makes me a little nervous the idea of traveling with the other students . i 'm friendly , but for whatever reasons i recognize that i 'm a bit distant and guarded about getting too close to fellow students . i 'm reserved about myself personally and feel anxious about knowing anyone outside of school . i 'm not quite sure why this is , but i recognize it 's happening .
so a long story short , we went to a doctor visit on december just to check that she was indeed gaining weight and that everything else was going well . well we go to the visit and her weight gain was perfect , better than anticipated they were so happy , and we were so happy too because we had been basically feeding her for hours straight , like a bunch of crazy people
then i opened it and someone had lined the lid with italian stationery in a design i also love and have used lots over the years , and still own a bit of something similar . i would have taken that as a sign to buy it , years back . this time i took it as a sign to think warm thoughts , take its photo , and leave it for someone else .
it 's realizing that the treatments you are now doing , are the end of the line for pregnancy . and here you are years older than when you first started this , when you thought you would be done , but really you are just beginning . it 's telling lucy she is going to have a little brother named jack . it 's hoping lucy will have a little brother named jack .
human rights are there for everyone . people demand we codify these with laws and legislation . we might not like what someone chooses to own or how they choose to live their life , but that does n't mean we should deny them the chance to do so . if you do n't stand up for what someone else believes in , how can you ask them to stand up for what you do
i found a whole mess of packaging with no toys inside . it was just garbage . it had no value at all . so i decided to throw it away . then i found some of those silly little toys . maybe it was from taco bell in a kids meal or something . and i threw those away . i even grabbed a few opened action figures and thought about throwing them away
at dinner with a few friends , an interesting discussion came up . a woman in a senior position is often more aggressive than a male counterpart . successful career women generally sit and cross their legs like a guy . a woman has to work more hours to prove herself than a male counterpart . women have had to change the way they look , think , speak and behave to fit in .
for many people , face time is equivalent with value . doctors are always trying to balance the number of patients they see with quality of care they can provide . if you have too many patients on your schedule , you re not going to be able to spend the quality time needed to meet everyone s needs . but if you see too few patients then you ca nt afford to continue .
our dining table can easily seat and has sat even at times but the best memories are of the hubby and i sitting together at one end while chatting about our day , the news , favorite baseball players and the delicious food . for too many years we ate in front of the television each night and now we both look forward to this time together where we completely focus on each other .
i called the local hotel we use for emergencies like this and booked a room . i told them i would arrive between . when i went out to the car around to go in search of dinner , it was bad . really bad . i about fell twice just in the parking lot . i went back in , got my stuff and decided to go straight to the hotel after dinner .
i think the biggest advice i could give is just do it . if you have an idea , if you have a passion , do nt wait . the timing is never right . life is too short not to do what you love . and i found out that when you do what you love especially something that s good for the world you usually find a way to make it work .
each week will stay the same from month to month when there is a fifth week in a month , the last week will be an extra week to participate for challenge . another exciting change is that the design team has been split into groups . group will be creating projects for the first and third weeks , and group will have the second and fourth . here 's the breakdown of the teams
as i have said on many occasions , we do not live in an abstract or theoretical world . we live in a world in which our clients face very real threats to their health and financial well being . i believe that we have an obligation to have frank discussions with our clients about life insurance products that can have a meaningful impact during their lifetime , as well as at their death .
this scale is basically a measure of a person 's set to respond ' do what is right ' in a variety of situations . what situations they are is relatively secondary as long as they are as near to ' real life ' as possible . it seems fairly clear , however , that there must be some temptation to social desirability responding also , and steps to control for this are indicated .
i got used to the idea . after all she is a grown up and can make her own decisions . plus , i was there for the kids . they would still be fed and told they were loved before school . actually , the time turned out to be quite nice . i was able to stay on top of things without worrying that what i was doing was being second guessed .
believe it or not , i started this piece just before the baby was born , and was working on it while we were down the shore on vacation and his mom was in labor with him . andrew , or drew as he is better known , took his own sweet time getting here . it 's a good thing he 's such a cutie his mom was in labor for almost two days
i 'm doing it because i need to i am moving on june , and desperately need to get as much packing done , and as much of my stuff into storage , as i possibly can while big m is gone for training so all we 'll have to do is move my furniture into storage when he gets back . hi that was the longest sentence , ever . count the commas .
tackle one area of your house day , and before you know it you ll have it sparkling clean from top to bottom if you re starting from scratch , then the first week or two will take up much of your time , because there may be areas that you have nt been cleaning on regular basis . but once you get a good deep cleaning done , up keep will be a breeze
little miss is officially without her two front teeth . she lost the first one on thursday at school , and the second one came out last night . she 's quite proud , and i have to admit that she 's pretty cute without them . the morning after her first front tooth , she proudly announced that the tooth fairy had given her a quarter from arizona , and she was thrilled .
i originally wrote this post several months ago . but , when it came time to share it my heart was too raw to really share it with a right heart . last week , god brought this whole thing to mind again and i was reminded that i do n't want to forget how i witnessed god 's hand . and , i want my children to hear my testimony of his grace .
i took the day before thanksgiving off this year to hang out with my son and do some baking . i knew i wanted to make coconut macaroon cookies , but i also wanted to make a pie for thanksgiving . after all , thanksgiving just is nt thanksgiving without some kind of pie . we are nt terribly fond of plain pumpkin pie at our house so i was looking for an alternative .
i used the easel card fold again to finish my card . i just love how easy this is and yet makes such a special finish to any card , making it ready to display right out of the envelope i 've used his card a lot and shared it already a few times with you but this time i 'm going to tell you how to make an easel card of your own .
i talked about it before that i hoped punkin would be ready to start the potty training process this spring summer . then he is was n't talking as much as i thought he would be and now he is talking up a storm and just did n't show as many of the signs of being ready as i thought . i know we are n't far but we are n't so close either .
i know a lot of people love this doctor , but to me i ca nt get excited about an earth bound doctor who did nt have access to his tardis . this doctor was written to be an older james bond . while i enjoy all things doctor who , this has to be my least favorite version . i prefer my doctor a little bit more time lord a little less secret agent .
fourth major change i planted flower beds . maybe it is nt that major to you , but getting my husband and i to commit to spending the money for stuff that gets put on the ground is pretty tough , but we finally did it and i am so glad we did . i will have to take some pictures for you of the finished look when i have a day of no rain .
life may not be fair at times , but you will have to learn to fight through it and in the end it will all turn out alright . do what you love and never let others tell you what you should be doing . always remember that although life will be a struggle , it s ok to go out there and have fun from time to time . it will keep you sane .
did you click that do , i 'll wait . are you smart enough for it cause i am not . i am an artist , an actor , a writer and i do.not.get.it . at the end of the day to me it 's just a naked chick on a bicycle , and a woman wearing a dress that she can pee in sitting on a wooden chair for hours a day being silent .
long story short , i broke up with my boyfriend . it was harder than i thought it would be , but the relationship simply could nt continue . i m trying very hard not to dwell on it , so i m not going to make this post all about him . after all , that s probably what he would want , right do nt give the enemy attention yeah , something like that
ok , really i gave her a few more details than that , and did n't shout the word died at her , but i was also thinking , could you fucking make a note of that in the front of my file because i do n't know why i have to hash this out with you people and explain to you why my doctor is sending me here every freaking time i show up .
the purpose of a reader s report whether for a publishing house or literary agency is to help the editor or an agent to evaluate whether or not a project is something that might be worth publishing , representing , considering , or even reading . when we ask you to do a report we are asking for honest feedback . we want to know your thoughts , all of them , on the book .
something started happening that made me realise there was a big problem with my approach . i had done everything the self motivation books said to do and that was the problem . none of them told me what do with the plan . if they did talk about it it was the small emphasis that did not go beyond mere mention that left me thinking it was more important to draw up the plan .
my mom and i were n't terribly close . i was placed in state care foster care at the age of , so i did n't get the chance to really spend most of my childhood with her . however , she was my mom . i loved her . and i know she loved me too , but never could show it as much as any other person . still , i felt it .
the packaging is very simple but still cute enough to have out on display on your bathroom shelf . the bottle is a little too hard to squeeze and it can be difficult to get product out off it . i think that a pump would be much more practical , maybe they will change that in the future . the consistency off the body lotion is just right , not to thick not to thin
i do n't know if that will get any better in the coming month . i 've got a house to decorate , cookies to bake , presents to wrap , and a cat to keep out of my christmas tree . but i know we 're all busy during december , so i ca n't really use that excuse . the excuse i will use , though , is my plethora of writing activities .
last weekend 's camping trip was an adventure , to be sure . we were n't even sure , when it started , that it was going to be a camping trip . leaving in the middle of the afternoon , we threw some camping gear in the car , in case we decided that it was something we wanted to do but , in reality , i was hoping to be home before midnight .
i lost my mother during the year . in fact , it will be a year this month . i ca n't believe how much harder it is a year later than even in the beginning . i wish i had held her hand more , had her over to the house more , sat down after a full day of shopping to have that cup of tea she always offered . i miss her .
to tell you the truth , i am a little afraid that the new book will take that away from me again and instead create flavour by enforcing all kinds of restrictions . it s also a valid strategy . it s just not something that i find interesting or inspiring . i think a good book should let me play the army i like , not the one everyone thinks i should be playing .
anything paranormal feels comfortable to me . i like to build my own world and write characters with abilities and skills that do nt occur in nature well , at least , our nature . i have written stories that are nt paranormal and i may write more in the future , but they re not my favorite kind of story to tell . i like the creativity that paranormal romance allows me to express .
you can often get a good handle on this from the language of the job description and the history of the role . the information provided will use more dynamic language if they are looking for the type of person who sees this as a transition role , or more subdued language if the culture of the organisation is such that they prefer a person who is likely to settle in for the long haul .
. i want to eat right . shrinking kitchen has been helping me with this . if you have n't been over there , you have no idea what you are missing . it is totally awesome and you need to check it out . we have some of the best healthy recipes there for you to try . i want to participate in menu plan your butt off . i can make the time .
and since i absolutely avoid all types of religious debates with my mom , and since i am not in the habit of being in any way rude to her , i did nt say , it ca nt be an answer to prayer if i did nt actually pray . instead i went on to tell her why it happened so quickly both the reason i was sure of and the reason i suspected .
i 've been making homemade yogurt for over a year now , and was thrilled to discover how easy it really is . our family goes through a lot of yogurt this past summer , the kids and i were given a free sample of greek style yogurt at the store . oh boy one look at the cost and i knew i had to come up with a way to make it at home .
i have been super busy today , baking chocolate cake , making vanilla pudding , egg salad and tuna salad . the boys requested a cake today and pudding too since i was in the kitchen . i made them their treats and decided to make some tuna and egg salad while i was at it . i have a girls night planned for tonight so i thought i would bring those with me for snacks
watching other parents has always inspired me . i tend to learn a lot from hearing how others interact , what they say , how they deal with a situation , etc . in the past few days , i 've really run into a few parents that i realize really inspire me and if i could just hang out with them more , i think i 'd be a better parent because of it o
nick is home for a week . he finished up his finals last wednesday and got home thursday night . he leaves next sunday for his summer job at camp . scott and i are thrilled to have him home and are enjoying every minute with him . the guys are planning to golf in much of their spare time . anyway , he is officially a junior in college . where did the time go
after participating in the weekend beta event , i felt that the game was really worth the wait . sure , there are some things that can be improved on . but you have to admit that they did a pretty good job bringing forth such a vibrant world and filling it with such diverse and interesting stories . below are some of my thoughts on the good things and bad things about the game .
i 'll admit that it is kind of cool to be able to easily change the size of my photos . i am pretty sure i could do this before , but you know , since i kept clicking my photos when i thought it would perhaps be worth the effort to copy and paste them into the right order , i realized just how easy it was to make this one a bit smaller .
i said i wanted to try the hot tub it was nt nearly as big as the one at the first hospital , and it was in a tiny little closet of a room , but i wanted to try . we asked for the cd player to get set up as the water filled . ooooo that was much better i really enjoyed being in the water . although i did nt like the rushing
bigger girls do tend to get ignored in social settings , such as clubs , pubs , parties etc . so we have to have a personality that draws people to us and makes them look beyond the number on the tag of our clothes . if we attract a guy s notice , it s not because you can see tasmania at the bottom of our skirt , it s because of our personality .
yesterday while the kids and i were playing the weeding game what , you do not know that game it s quite simple , who can pick the most weeds in x amount of time . the prize is a happy mommy and a weed free flower bed . win win for all the flower bed , an activity that involves all kids , and mama gets to check one thing off her spring list .
and where do i go from here i 've struggled with depression and anxiety for much of my life . i 'm drawn that way it 's in my bones . i put my pills in the medicine cabinet , and perhaps i will need to resort to them again . but for now , i 'm at peace with my negative emotions . and am cognizant that they may occur , but will pass .
i am still learning how to listen when the universe is trying to tell me something . sometimes the signs are so obvious , it 's practically being screamed . but sometimes they are so subtle that you really have to be quiet and open up your ears . i have definitely learned that i need to be more open to the voices . anyone else have a story about the universe trying to tell them something
i feel like there are a million things running through my head right now but for some reason i am not really able to put them into logical thoughts that can be written out . i m sure that s from the stress of it all and from being exhausted . it does nt help either that we are leaving for the appointment in just seven short hours and i still have nt gotten to sleep .
after my run this morning i went upstairs to shower and caught reflection in the mirror . i began wondering if i would ever like what i saw in the mirror . was nt that long ago almost a year now.that i was over pounds . my doctor told me each year at my annual check up i needed to lose weight . i would lose a few pounds and put it right back on again .
then there are our moms . my mother in law raised both her children as a single mom and always tried to provide the best for them . as my mother in law , she has been supportive , kind , and loving to me . we have the relationship of good friends , and i have gone to visit her several times without my husband . i struck gold in the mother in law department .
before settling for an outfit , i looked around online to get inspired , and i was happy to see that most first day at work outfits were relatively similar , and more or less what i had in mind . i stumbled across amanda s blog , and i absolutely love her style so i was thrilled when her first day at work combo , looked so similar to what i had picked out for myself
occasionally i bring lunch for my kids in school . i love observing the children in school especially the little ones . it is even more fun to watch the young ones at the beginning of the year . watching them struggle with breaking a hard boiled egg shows me the independence that a child learns away from home in big school for the first time . it is quite a wonder to watch them really .
i do n't know why i have n't wanted to blog . partially i guess because this pregnancy has consumed me . second is there 's a lot going on with my pregnancy but so much of it is more personal that i should share and i am trying to respect my eric 's desire for me not to share everything about this . after all , me being pregnant has everything to do with him .
does this mean that hill never made any submissions at all not quite . one client , whose submission package had supposedly been sent to nine publishers , discovered that three had actually received it . since her work was not appropriate for their lists , all three had rejected without comment . according to the reports she got from hill , however , those submissions as well as the fictional ones were still under consideration .
i read that line in an article today about women who put off having children in order to pursue their education career dream of living in a foreign country first . only when they reach the height of their preconceived life before kids ideal do they settle down and start a family . and once they have kids , they easily transition into a life of full time working mom . or so it may seem .
the one i probably did this to the most was my sister . she and i shared a bedroom on and off and at different times , we both said things and did things that were not the way we would ever want to be captured on a family home movie . for this , i am genuinely sorry . thankfully , we did have some wonderful times full of fun days in the mix too .
it was a cool first day and cool to be at the first actionfest ever . i hope to see it grow in the future , especially so i can bitch about kids these days and how in my day i had to eat peanut butter and white bread out of the back of my car just to be able to finally see the good , the bad , and the weird on the big screen .
while chatting with a fellow nail polish lover , she mentioned to me that she was looking for an orange red , like the sunset . she wanted something that would represent the saying red sky at night , sailor 's delight red sky in the morning , sailor 's take warning . i promptly hopped up , ran to my polish lab and threw some things together . what you see here in the result .
i am hoping that after some sleep last night and a good nap today , we wo nt have to worry about me making any wrong decisions today . to any one who says it s the just the terrible two s is mistaken . it s one s , two s , three s , and since we re over half way there im expecting at least part of the four s . wish me luck
a few months ago at christmas we were shopping in the mall . we decided to stop and go to dinner . after we were done , we headed to the bookstore next door . we were in there for a good minutes when this random lady walks up to us and says , hey , did i see you guys eating next door we said , yes , that was us . then she said .
well , this is a small sample . surely the policies of the free market republicans means that soon there will be scores of other health insurance companies chomping at the bit to get this man 's business or , it could mean that the market is telling this citizen to die or get the hell out of the way so that nice diabetes free family pictured above can sign up for one of these plans .
so , it 's been just recently that i 've been able to get out and about with my camera . but now that the warm weather seems to really be on its way , and the world is starting to turn green again we already need to mow our yard , it 's time for more photography friday and hopefully this year i 'll remember to bank a few good pictures to use next winter .
that 's the way the dance works i do not know you , and likewise you do not know me . it 's my job to provide the sign , and it 's your job to recognize your name . and then walk up and stand in front of me . if you choose not to participate in the dance , even after you have said you would , be not surprised if i go home .
to me it 's straight forward a welsh speaking patient should n't need to ask for a welsh service , it should be offered to them as a matter of course . not that everyone in the health service in wales needs to speak welsh , but for example in the absence of a relative or career a hospital based welsh speaking companion would assist greatly by reducing the worry and confusion of the ill patient .
i can remember waiting at the train station with my grandfather waiting because we had come too early , way too early . my grandfather was not a man to cut it fine , to race the clock , to risk being late . i remember wanting to cry , such was my frustration , and then actually crying . . . for no other reason than that i could not stand the limbo of waiting .
he chose the cake form my cake books it was the spider one out of one of the australian women 's weekly books , but then he made some design changes , such as no big spider and lots of other bugs stuck in the web . he also thought the web was better grey rather than black as in the book as this way it looked more like a web . i am happy with simple
now , here at turn off the television , we have never forced an opinion on someone or told people in any shape or form that there is a right or wrong answer . we re media . we might be small , but we re still media . the job of the media is to present both sides of an opinion issue and let the public decide for themselves what they want to believe , right
commitment is a pretty personal thing . what s easy for one person can be excruciatingly difficult for someone else . so i decided to break it down by a stuff you may not have known about before , but that really does nt require any lifestyle changes b stuff that requires some lifestyle change or financial commitment and c those things that require not only more effort , but possibly a complete change of lifestyle .
the more i listened in this attitude , the better i felt , although we never talked about me and i did nt provide any advice . focusing on her fully made me feel great , and that was amazing . the day after , she sent me a text message to thank me for the great conversation and some comment that made me feel something happened , while all i did was listening and connecting .
a couple of years ago , while our research team was working on a project in grant county in deep rural east central oregon read our report or journal article , we had the opportunity to sit in on an economic summit for the county . the local extension agent pointed out that the two industries that formed the historic economic base of the county timber and cattle were both in long term , permanent decline .
i still ate right low fat , high fiber . i just ate too much . i started not writing down what i ate but rather just kept track of it my head . i also cut back on exercise . it got cold out so i quit walking outside and i never started back with my indoor exercise . all this resulted in weight gain . i knew better but i became ok with it .
i found out that he knows a few things about me that nobody else knows . i do nt know how he knows or who he talked to . i guess teachers can get information somehow . but i m scared that he s going to tell people and make me look foolish . there was quiet as he tried to put together everything she had just said and focus on driving at the same time .
nobody wants to entertain the thought that they did anything wrong . ever . and if that s true of most americans , i imagine not many israeli are eager to even engage in this thought process , so painful and personal the issue may be . as i said earlier , people are not naturally inclined to understand others , especially if that person is a stranger and your parents have warned you against him .
it s always about the work and the writing . get out there , get your work out there , get feedback , become a better writer , learn about the craft of writing , try new techniques in your own stories , read everything you can in the genre in which you write , build your own buzz , join groups , visit every site you can and make comments . you can do it .
right from the very beginning your taken on an emotional ride , i myself have never suffered such a loss but for whisper to have suffered such a tragic loss and still find the courage she needed , it 's just amazing . with heather 's unique writing style you truly could feel the emotion pouring from the pages , i was brought to tears many times . here 's a little something to go on ...
as usual , we could n't have pulled this off without the help of our fantastic customers and friends . all the material and cloth that covered the shelves was borrowed , as were the trestle tables which we used to build the long table . the publishers were great in making sure we got the signed copies that we 'd asked for and we even managed to borrow the plates from the cafe next door .
my brother tommy also left this life before i was ready . i 've written about him several times before . the labels are tom , tommy , and brother . i still miss him . some days it hurts to think about him . most days i have peace because i believe he is with others i love , just out of sight , in that spiritual world we can not see with our human eyes .
the craft we tried was kind of a bust and the kids were n't big fans . i figured that because the kids love oobleck so much that cloud dough would be a hit . we could n't seem to blend it well enough for it to be able to be formed and just mixing it was n't nearly as cool as i thought it would be . no photos of this one today either . sorry .
for myself i have been thinking a lot about the years of alex 's active addiction and his ongoing recovery . at first it was easy to focus on the millions of my little and big mistakes and how those must have been the trigger to that terrible path for my son and myself . there are no answers to those issues . it is best to leave those mistakes where they are , in the past .
i loved this book , and it s my initial impression was that it was my favorite since all together dead . admittedly , the first part dragged . i was severely annoyed by typographical errors before i d even made it to because i paid . for the kindle version , which publishers say is justified because of all the cost of professional development like editing that goes into a book . but i continued on .
marketing can be a real balancing act for sure . plan your act carefully . practice the tricks you 'll be using and then when you 're ready you can hit the stage and perform before a real audience . one thing you do n't want to do when you 're in the spotlight is drop the balls , but if you do just pick them up and act as though it 's part of the act .
the blur should be short , somewhere in the to character range . after all it has to fit on the back of the book but it also needs to be a quick pick me type of a sale . a short quick description will hold the reader s attention long enough for you to finish . after all you want them to make a decision based on your whole sales pitch , not half of it .
without giving away too much , i was annoyed that they had nt fixed him , and was saddened and depressed by how the book ended . in the movie , they took out a lot of the questions and confusing details , and made the story much more romantic in my opinion . whether you loved the book , hated the book , or have never even read the book you have to see this movie .
however , come valentine 's day , the majority of flowers sold are overwhelmingly bought by men why is this what is stopping men buying flowers the rest of the year i know i 'm a lucky woman i do n't want them on the th of february , that 's commercial obligation , it does n't make me feel ' special ' . out of the blue , that is what matters and does it for me
it does not mean a little bit of cheese now and again is okay , it does not mean it is alright to eat fish because they swim rather than walk , it does not mean it is fine to use honey because some people refuse to accept bees as animals , it does not mean home collected free range eggs which i once saw a fruitarian describe as chicken fruit and acceptable on a fruitarian diet .
i felt the characters were nt as well developed as they could have been . teresa is an extremely important character yet she is just so flat . thomas was a bit of a disappointment as well and his character really does nt develop until almost the end of the book . on the other hand certain secondary characters were so deeply created that they at times had a larger impact on me than the main character .
the first book has to be the best one you can make it . i love series potential as do publishers , but make sure all the main loose ends are tied up in this first book . if you are writing a trilogy , i would say something in your cover letter like , the book has series potential but do nt tell me all about books two and three . let me enjoy one first .
the most literal understanding of daily bread is a loaf of bread in my hands to last me for the day . some might say that is all that he means for us to ask for . i believe it is better to expand daily bread to include all that others and we need . i would , in fact , extend it beyond the material and into prayers for the needs of our bodies and our hearts
his coming into the world to reveal the glory of god was for you and me . his death on the cross was for you and me , to save us from sin . his resurrection from the dead was for you and for me , to save us from death . and , now we offer ourselves , not as if we did some great thing . rather it is the service we owe from gratitude .
anyhow i had this very vivid dream about a woman wearing a yellow shirt that had red lipstick painted on it . and it was a familiar woman , but not so much a woman who i am familiar with . one of those weird instances where someone makes an appearance in your dream , and from then on they just kind of stand out more than they used to . we ll it s like that .
the form pretty much explains itself . i have a spot to put in the location , the address , admission fees for adult , youth and child , whether or not it would be a day trip , if it 's an indoor or outdoor activity , and would we go again always important , especially if it 's something you have to pay for . if the kids do n't enjoy themselves , why go again
my co worker told me yesterday that the recovery period could take me up to six months , if not more . the emotional and mental aspects of the recovery come along a lot slower , but the body and mind needs a lot of time . she said for me to be patient with everything , and that 's a hard thing for me to do since i tend to be in a rush with everything .
i have n't been at my computer the past few days . mr d and i went to new york city on friday see photo below . it was a great day i always love spending the day with just him and getting out of the house . too many days are spent on the couch we both start new jobs tomorrow , so it was nice to have a day to ourselves before new stresses start .
when we help our children , they in turn help others . i truly believe in seeing our children as whole , perfect people in all of their desires . i assume positive intent from my children and they feel this . i am never the wall between them and what they want in life . they know that we will always help them obtain their desires , and they in turn help me in so many ways
while building the momentum transfer model , we need a new representation for thinking about how momentum is transferred between objects . it has to include a before and an after portion since we use the model to talk about what happens over a change in time . and in fact , we usually are talking about some relatively exciting thing that happens by analyzing the states of the objects immediately before and after the event occurs .
we finished the soul rush tour and settled into the long , hot summer days in an old hotel somewhere in houston , and prepared for the big event . i thought at the time that this was it the end of the world as we knew it . i remember calling my parents and friends and telling them to try to come to houston . we were all that brainwashed and believed everything we were told .
this post shall be largely on my personal experiences onboard this tour . i shall offer some leads and contact information of the relevant services that i had came across as part of the tour . however , since i am neither a trained medical professional nor a master in any of these traditional methods of healing , there will be very limited sharing on the traditional methods of healing i had came across during the tour .
hello i 'm back from a long weekend in dc , visiting my brother and his girlfriend . i 'm really excited to announce that my master bedroom was featured in the brand new house of fifty magazine the fall issue is out today , and it is really fantastic lots of color and pattern , which is my favorite . please go here to check out the whole issue , and my room is on page .
diversity in literature is an important topic that is being actively debated across the publishing industry . everyone should be able to open up a book and read about a character who looks like them , shares their beliefs andor life experiences , and who can serve as a role model for their own existence . that same diversity needs to be reflected on the covers of the books , and in the photos of their authors .
but the real big news around our house is bug related . while we have n't been really focused on the issue , we have been talking about how exciting it is for big kids to use the potty rather than doing business in their diapers . every now and again , bug sits on the potty with no real success other than a slightly delayed nap time , which i 'm sure she considers a victory .
i 'm still not very good at meditation , even though i 've been doing it for a few years . but occasionally , i catch a wave . i ca n't tell you how refreshing it is to empty all the noise out of your head and sit in perfect silence , do nothing and , best of all , think nothing . it 's a peace you 'll never experience while juggling cell phone conversations .
i 've stuck with this strategy since deciding to pursue my writing goals . it took me nearly three years from the decision point to the day i signed a contract with an agent . but i did n't quit . of course i doubted it would ever happen , and i feared my writing was n't good enough , but i kept working to improve my writing skills , and i kept sending out query letters .
onto a slightly different note a few months ago , i told you i was working on a ' special creation ' . well it turns out that it might be ready a little earlier than expected . i have been informed by my doctor that the timer could go off at any moment i am tired , anxious , excited , curious but more importantly i am ready . it has been almost nine months after all
sometimes i ll be writing for so long that i start missing things . plenty of times i ve come across missed words or even half a sentence that suddenly stops short . i think i ve written it but i have nt . oddly enough , i still remember what words are missing and stare at the page as if someone has stolen them , thinking i m sure i wrote that sentence . where is it
ross once said to me that i was the third most difficult person to know that he had ever met . i laughed inside , because he was frustrated with me , because to me he was the most difficult person to know that i had ever met . i think that we were both used to other people opening up to us and not really having to say that much about ourselves until we chose to .
before i tell you about our next challenge i would just like to let you know that i am still very much looking at setting up our vintage affair design team . as the site grows i am hoping that i can bring together one very talented and inspiring group of designers to inspire you every month . so on that note i would like to introduce you to our first design team member the lovely and very talented
then came a few years where it was , he s yours , i m not ready to be a father scenario played out , of course it did nt help that k was away at university in a city hours away from us . so time goes on , o struggles through university living with us so we could help with the baby then changes educational plans and successfully graduates and is now in the working world .
with the feature in mind , i decided to put together a french themed week .. ' somewhere in france ' .. art and photography put together from my trip last year , with a little bit of french countryside , a bit of paris and whatever else takes my fancy . so .. if you can .. tune back in later this week as i will be posting more often than my lazy self has been of late
it is n't easy to humble yourself it can be hard to say , i was wrong . please accept my apology and forgive me . but think what happens to relationships when we do that . some people are willing to forgive and move on , what a blessing others have a hard time and then the relationship is lost , which is so very sad . all you can do is your part to reach halfway .
it is an easy way to see a lot of an area in a short time . plus , when you do n't know where you are , you do n't know how far you are going or how far you have left to go and for me , that makes it so much easier when i know the distances , i will play the numbers game in my head and that just makes the run seem longer .
organised criminality from china is now apparent at km market . particularly so with massive illegal currency exchange at a market that works strictly with cash , turns over millions in a day . it is not in your face , you do need to know who s who and what s what , but it is there and it is chinese run at least at the coal face and we are talking about a lot of money .
yesterday was an incredibly stressful day pretty much from the get go . first thing there was drama with shiro . shiro and i have this weird relationship at this point we re more than friends , we mess around , but there s no romantic interest at least on my end . actually we plan to sit down and try to figure out what we each want out of the relationship but that s another issue entirely .
right away , we hear about these breathers . the way the family talks about them , you d think that the devil himself was hunting them . and yet we do nt know what they are yet because the writers have chosen to make them a mystery . well guess what that mystery is a storytelling device to keep us , the reader , interested . we will keep reading until we see these breathers for ourselves .
this is n't a new goal . i consider my family to be in one of the top spots on my priority list . but sometimes during breaks , it is easy to fall into a to do trap . it is easy to make all kinds of plans , spend time with the kids , and love them lots ... but not necessarily put their choices of how to spend time at the top of the day .
what an exciting announcement i have for you i would like to introduce two fabulous ladies joining our design team this week . they are both extremely talented and will bring a new and fresh approach to the midnight madness sketch challenge . if you have never visited their blogs before or seen their work , i encourage you to do so . you will be amazed by their creative talents before we get into our weekly details ,
last night we celebrated fat tuesday with just our family . this is really different from our normal celebration with neighbors and friends . fat tuesday is usually a production at our house . this year it followed too closely after two birthdays , valentine 's day and a five days of travel over president 's day weekend . i decided it was better to remain sane and enjoy the day rather than pack in one more thing .
' it could be , but it 's not . mary is shown with a book because it is her own book , her message that she has left these for us to find . and i hope it will give us insight in to the mystery of her oldest son and his fate , because we just do n't know . i 'm hoping that the magdalene will put that mystery to rest for us herself . '
american wife i really liked this book , but i do n't think its one i will read again . it 's an interesting spin on laura bush and her transformation to first lady , but as we were talking about it in our book club meeting , we found that we did n't really like the main character all that much , however engrossed we were in the story . i 'd give it out of five stars
i used the three act structure to write ' heaven can wait ' the morning i woke up with the idea , i started looking for what the initial problem is , how to make it worse , and how to solve it . it worked fine , mainly because structurally , ' heaven can wait ' is n't very complicated , and that gave me lots of room to make the characters interesting and the world rich .
i 'm always one to plan things , to have hopes and dreams of things to do or be , and i ca n't do that anymore . i feel like i 've lost myself . i hope things somehow get better , but i 'm not sure they will . i 've tried to keep a positive attitude , and somehow i 've lost it . if someone finds it , kindly send it back my way ...
we always claim to be for jesus and no other , but we continue to doubt the little things that make him god . if you are indeed a child of god , no matter what anyone says or does to you , your faith in your god must remain and no one will be able to take you away from him . therefore if you waive in faith , then you re not truly jesus s own .
i love to laugh and i think a whole lot of stuff is chuckle worthy , so it was pretty cool when i realized my kid was developing the same sense of humor i have especially when i realized she could have wound up with her dad s . we spend a lot of time laughing at each other , at ourselves , at other people but not in a mean way mostly , at life . we like
i told you last night that i might be gone sometime , and you said , where , and i said , to be with the good lord , and you said , why , and i said because i m old , and you said , i do nt think you re old . and you put your hand in my hand and you said , you are nt very old , as if that settled it .
sadly disappointment can also occur for no other reason than life is not fair and bad things happen . this means that just because we want something does nt mean we are going to get it . but it does mean that as soon as we realise that we will fail at things or people will let us down , we can move on and put the disappointment on a shelf along with our other life experience memorabilia .
ladies , help i m going to a wedding in april that goes from day to evening so it could be both hot and cold but it is indoors so that should nt matter too much . there will be dancing so i have to be able to move . here s the thing , i have no money and need to pull something amazing out and hair ideas and makeup ideas . what can you do for me
i could go on and on , but i think you already get the idea . in addition to all of the stuff i just listed , she was also by georgia s side at every treatment and every doctor s appointment . she made sure that they celebrated every milestone and every test result that showed georgia was winning her battle . and she also made sure that ivy felt included and important throughout the entire year .
being quite a student of leadership i have read quite widely on the subject . this title is one that has taken a place pretty near the top of my favorites . it hardly matters the leadership role you find yourself in this is a book that will be very relevant . so for the teacher , coach , parent , business leader , etc . there will be much to motivate , encourage , and correct you .
most of us , in different moments and seasons in our lives , we have thought about our health . i have come to realize that health is not just the good results of my annual medical checkups . health is a much more complex subject . health is not only physical but also emotional and spiritual . talking about health , we need to look at it as a package addressed to our body , soul and spirit .
businesses that produce goods are more likely to introduce new production or businesses processes as well as new or significantly improved products . this is a result of considerable research and development that takes place . according to the research , while manufacturing makes up only about of gdp , it is responsible for the overwhelming majority of domestic research and development spending by companies . it is this research and development that is a critical component of innovation .
and for those of you who have found there way back to the sewing machine . i have a feeling that not everyone will have found their way back so there will probably be fewer blocks in this drawing . also , i am taking the kids to see their great grandma who lives a good hour a way . we will probably be home late . i may not be able to get to the computer before morning .
over the past months , i have worked really hard to lose weight and have lost about pounds . this was my personal goal . i began taking better physical care of myself after receiving some disturbing , not life threatening news about my health . ironically , the news i received had nothing to do with my weight , but i took the news as a wake up call to start taking better care of my physical self .
so i just took it easy , which does nt mean it was an easy workout . i got in a good workout but i did nt push myself . my goal of the workout was to get my heart rate up check and stretch out my muscles check all in an attempt to help my body prepare for tomorrow s mile tempo run at in the morning check , i think . i guess i ll know tomorrow .
i know the passages at the top of this letter about the judgment seat of christ are true , but i do nt understand how sins that have been taken away , that are behind god s back , if the lord does nt mark our iniquities, then how will these sins suddenly be there again for the lord to view i find that thought so disturbing . if you can help me with this i would appreciate it .
homeschool questions thoughts i have i have been thinking a lot lately on how to add a little spice to our school days . i really enjoy the days that we take time away from the books and do special crafts or learning units on a particular subject . i also enjoy watching the girls work together as a team . this does not happen very often , but when it does it is a wonderful sight to see .
i had a ton of stuff hanging on my walls that i really did n't think fit the look or feel i was going for , so most of this went straight into storage boxes . other stuff i decided to take with me . it really is n't that stressful when i broke it down as only removing the things on my wall instead of trying to tackle a floor to ceiling area like i had been dreading .
my friend told me yesterday about pinterest . i 'd never heard of it until then . we were shopping at a shop and the owner there mentioned pinterest , too . so i went on it and looked around . it seems very interesting . i asked for an invite , but i 'm on the waiting list . hopefully , i 'll get the invite soon so i can get on there and start my pin boards .
i still have many things to tell you , but you ca nt handle them now . but when the friend comes , the spirit of the truth , he will take you by the hand and guide you into all the truth there is . he wo nt draw attention to himself , but will make sense out of what is about to happen and , indeed , out of all that i have done and said . john
and i love that it 's the city where i fell in love . where i met my beautiful , kind , and caring wife , whose heart is as big as california itself . who took me in not despite but because of eccentricities . it was in this landscape where we first looked deeply into each others eyes and saw the future spread out fifty years before us . and it was always here . right here .
this is a pretty good query at this point , but now you need to make sure your novel shows the same polish . are you over explaining there did you front load the novel with a bunch of backstory and set up one way to find out is to look at where the novel starts . does it start with marine dancing with the duke if it does not , you might want to think about changing that .
has anyone ever told you that you remind them of your daughter or son and have you noticed the quality of this relationship what if there was a society where everyone reflected on , explored with awareness , this desire and capacity to help others succeed , even for only one day a year we are presented with a very great and auspicious opportunity through the existence of this holiday . indeed , mother s day goes deep within .
so she does both , and she tries out for this dance at school , but her and her friends do not get pick because they re not good enough , so they end up being in a play by one of the teachers , because the teacher does nt have any students starring in it . also , it s because no one really watches it , they all go watch the pretty girls do the dance thing .
the past emerged into the present , science merged into history and politics , and a larger picture took shape . whether this big picture has any truth to it or is simply the result of a mind seeking patterns where none exist , does nt really matter , at least not to me , not any more . i never had an emotional stake in the resolution of the mysteries . i simply wanted to know the truth .
after a few days the sales associate called me and told me my ring was ready to be picked up and i was more than happy to go get it . i had the ring back for literally two days before the same exact diamond fell out again . so i called and was assured i would n't be charged a fee and was told i could bring my ring back in and they would fix it for free .
everyone says it goes too quickly and it does . but he 's my baby the last child i 'll ever have and while i feel thrilled for him to have a birthday , i 'm sad for me because he 's growing up . if i was younger i would be tempted to have a third , but it 's really not a good idea for me to ever be pregnant again so it 's not an option .
many are speaking of really feeling the changes in and around them and veils are opening . always always surrender to the process and to the love of the divine mother and keep a watch on that internal dialogue . it is such a small step , but it has such great effects in your life . when the critical mind is switched off , you can get a glimpse of the peace which is you and your true nature
. was it worth it i ca n't trace any sales back to the ads , but the ads had over half a million views over the course of the campaign , so at least it raised awareness of the book . i think they may have encouraged a few people to add the book to their shelves . i 'd like to try a goodreads giveaway when i have paper books and see if that 's more effective .
and i guess that brings me to my next point . anything , even good things , can sometimes be taken too far . so today i want to thank my family for forcing me to sometimes hit the pause button on my writing . i want to thank my oldest daughter for asking me about all the characters in my stories , but also requesting that i please , mama , work on your book when we all asleep
ah , he said and took a reluctant seat . i tried to find some safe , pleasant topic to occupy us as we waited for the other three , a challenge given that these were the two people with the very least in common and the most obvious discomfort with one another . another fifteen minutes passed . michael , it seemed , was not going to make it after all . i hoped that he was alright .
a few months ago , i wrote a long post about pesto and my banner basil crop , put a bunch of photos together , and then never got around to actually publishing it all . here 's the short version that bad luck with basil i had in may it eventually turned out to be really good . like well over pounds of basil from plants good . yes you 'll find all my basil growing posts here .
keep myself a priority . this , too , is a hard one . if i am busy , anything for myself flies out the window as it s the easiest thing to do away with . i fall into that trap too easily and then it s hard to snap out of it . so , i must do my best to keep myself at the top of the list and learn to manage everything else around it .
seemed a little strange . i mean , he did n't appear to be in immediate distress . nothing a little benadryl could n't handle , right but , not wanting to mess around with it , i grabbed his shoes and told him we were going on a car ride . and am i ever glad we went then . by the time we got to the hospital , about minutes later , things had gotten pretty bad .
working out with friends is fun . it provides a distraction from the workout and usually can keep me going for longer since i do nt want to let my partner down . my problem is that i love working out in the morning . my schedule this semester has me not in the classroom before noon every day so i have plenty of time to wake up and get ready to start my day my friends not so much .
not everyday is a strong day . despite keeping busy and talking with friends , i still felt sad today . not so much because i no longer have my wife , per se . i can honestly say that if she came begging for me to take her back , i would not even consider it . but the emotional hole that has been left in her absence can still be felt . i do nt like being alone .
not every thing i write is great . really , most of the things i write are nt even okay . i m ashamed i hit publish on many things really . the important thing is i mark every writing effort as practice that makes me better . typically a lack of response from people tells me that something is awful , but this guy was nice enough to tell me , which leads to the next point . . .
you have the choice to alter a clock or any other item this week . the catch is it has to be for your space . it could be something you will use to organize other things in , something for your wall , a sign for your room or just something pretty for your desk . you just have to find something to alter . that is the creativity challenge . but please , make sure you get a clock
in other news , i think i 'm moving out on my own by the end of summer . it 's time i adore my brother but i 'm itching to have my own place again . it will be scary as i 'm looking at a house instead of an apartment but i keep telling myself it will allow me to have a honest to goodness studio . think positive thoughts about me making the right and good decisions .
that s when i found out . so i broke up with him straight away . that was enough . i moved out a few weeks later . i could have done it sooner but i had to plan a big move abroad as me and chris are not from the same country . he kept thinking i was nt going to leave so he never said anything . he cried when i told him i wanted to break up .
i think over my options , there is only one , they kill kids and i walk to the door , and yell loud enough for the thugs outside and my family inside to hear , it 's the fbi , do n't be scared , just be quiet and sit down i open the door and am looking at michael anderson 's wife . they have her in front of them , between us , and she is crying .
well , there you have it . my cards for the year . and now maybe you see why i was so far behind that i needed the card from yesterday 's post to finish out my list . and since heart heart decided to make this week 's challenge a virtual christmas card exchange , tell me which one is your favorite and i 'll get one out to you right away ... in a virtual sort of way .
you do not have to be pound foot blonde to be beautiful . take for instance , british tv . have you watched it lately my husband is from wales and we lived there for a while . i was shocked at how plain and ordinary people looked on their programs . ridiculous right but in the usa we plaster it on for the camera . who set the norm and why did we let them without putting up a fight
lately i feel like i do n't have much to wear . oh i have pretty dresses and skirts which i do wear but not a whole lot of everyday stuff . most of my summer go to 's have been packed away because they are too big in the bust . so , i have decided to make myself some things for summer that will get worn over and over easy stuff that wo n't need special laundry care .
i know i said i was doing this just for myself and was not even sure anyone would find this interesting , but it is surprising how many people from the real non virtual world have approached me in the street , at the school gate , in the local cafe , at parties or even in meetings to comment on the images . you maybe a quiet bunch on line but i am glad to know you are out there
spring came early in nj . for two weeks solid , it was degrees out . for me , the weather presented a test of discipline . see , i just started a new job that allows me to work full time from home . as i sat in my home office with the window open , warm breeze blowing in , it was a true test to stay put and focus on training and work . but i did it
it took a while to make my flower , but in the end took less time than deciding on the background why is that so often the case probably because i rarely plan what i 'm going to do before getting stuck in . i feel this is also the reason that after making something like this my desk always looks lie someone emptied the contents of every shelf and drawer on to it which , to be fair , i did
i hate the feeling it 's just this sick feeling in the pit of my stomach . there was no reason to feel it today none . it was clear , i think , there was no danger . i could see them for most of the time . it reminds me of the time elie went running off do n't you trust me except at least then i could explain that there might have been a reason to be upset .
think also of the thief on the cross . he acknowledged that he and the other thief were getting what they deserved . they had committed crimes , their lives were literally over , wasted , finished . but in turning to jesus and asking to be remembered , even at that late hour , the full stop in his life became a new and amazing story i tell you the truth . today you will be with me in paradise .
on this morning , i was driving to work , but had left home early enough to stop if i saw the right scene , in pleasant light . here s one image i stopped to make . initially , i pointed my camera toward the just risen sun , but that was nt the image i wanted . so , i turned around , and saw the clouds , the sky , the yellow leaves , and the tree line .
i suspect each and every novel i write will take on a life of its own , which is a good thing , but also means the process wo n't ever look exactly the same . what worked last time may be worthless this time . or parts of the process may work just fine , but i may look at others and think , how on earth did i ever think it was a good idea to do it like that
it s too bad my parents can no longer come along to montana . that would have been perfect stupid , expensive roof . but maybe uncle howard and aunt linda can come . aunt linda is a good time girl . either way , cool and i make our own fun . and we will make sure to have directions and stuff ahead of time this year since cell phones apparently do nt work at all in the whole state .
we had fun in this class because that was the intent of the class . and yet people grew into new areas too . so did i. having the intent to feel good in the now , and go with the feeling of that into the future does produce desired growth . there is the intention of discovering your feeling place of feeling good . there is no goal to press forward into , to stress about , to make happen .
instead of making him an appointment i questioned him , and then sent him to the er . i had dinner in the oven and no hope of child care until pm so it was the best i could do . honestly , i thought it would probably turn out to be nothing . maybe it was just a panic attack or heartburn or something really simple . he 's only . it ca n't be his heart . not yet .
once we graduate our lives still are not ours . i will have to find a job , one that i enjoy or one that i do not , to pay back the thousands of dollars in loans i will have built up from attending college in the first place . i realize that i do have control over working hard and finding a job that i love , but it has to fit into this box of what is conventional .
you know what , i m proud of the men and women who have pulled up their socks , put in the extra hours , and did what they had to do to financially support their loved ones . i m proud of those who have accepted not settled with , but accepted a job that they may not enjoy as much as another , simply because they are trying to make ends meet and can not financially afford the alternative .
i chose a college primarily because of its reputation as a party school . after all , college was nt just about getting an education and launching my career it was also about having a good time , right and boy , did i ever have a good time so good , in fact , that i quickly found that things like going to class , doing my homework , and showing up for tests were all getting in the way .
kim said something the other day about friends . she said that she does n't think that it really works too well to have a lot of acquaintances . she thinks that a friendship requires lots of time to grow and survive , and with the time we have in this life , you either make a lot of acquaintances , or have a few friends . i guess i 'm trying it both ways to see what works for me .
now i have nt told you about my best friend for you to see how great our relationship is . in fact i left out a lot of information about our relationship in order to dive in to the principles of building relationships . in truth we have been through quite a bit together and i trust him with my life . after reading my description of our friendship can you pick out what the key principles are to forming meaningful relationships
i suppose i have quite a visual imagination , though that 's probably true of most writers . i always see scenes very clearly in my mind . so clearly , in fact , that i never need to sketch them . sometimes i make little drawings of things after i 've written them , but i 'm not a good enough artist to draw those huge scenes properly if i were , i would never have needed to start writing .
today , all of us sat down to watch a funny movie on television . we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly munching the snacks that i had taken care to make much to the surprise of my husband and son . we made plans as to how we would spend our weekend , where we would go , whom we would visit , what games we would play and also can i watch at least an hour of cartoon television by my son .
honestly , if you live in asia where the filling ingredients are easy to find and buy pre made , and most of the other ingredients for the skin are also prepared for you , it 's not really hard at all . if you live in the west , where the ingredients may be more difficult to find and you 'd have to make everything from scratch by yourself , then yes , i 'd say it would be tougher .
i 've written here , at some point , about the amount of books and related material that i 've read , or watched , about the two world wars . my thirst for knowledge about it was based on , on the one hand , the need for historical perspective to be able to have a sense of what informed the flow of events and how these have shaped the subsequent decades upon which they still have a huge impact .
i use to say to myself why do i need to pray or even go through the spiritual change when god , already knows the outcome of my words and actions for many years i was blind to the fact it s not for gods , gratification of watching us fail at times . but instead a sign of respect towards god , and a learning process for ourselves since we do nt know the outcome of the situations we face daily
maybe it was the electric radio my mom bought me for christmas . but it could nt be that , because nine days later , on january , , one of my two brothers and my sister tried to take the radio away from me . i made the mistake of trying first to hang onto the radio , and then hanging onto the cord , accidentally pulling the cord out , so my christmas present only worked for nine days .
if our father knows what we need before we ask , why should we pray there are two reasons . the first is because of the rewards of prayer that go beyond just meeting our needs . the second is that there are many other things for which to pray such as the needs of others and the advancement of the father s kingdom . we do not need such things , but they should have a place in our prayers .
this photo was taken late in the afternoon . i had gone for a hike with my dog we had even met up with a black bear , which was both scary and a dream come true , and we ended up at this lake just me and my dog and some ducks . i was busy taking photos when i noticed a rainbow , and then the train came in , and i though , oh , this is good .
so , what did you do did all the family get together and cousins all play football baseball tag , etc while the grown ups chatted away that 's what happened here after a wonderful meal and even better fellowship , we all packed up and made our rounds to the hospital . it was truely a wonderful day that could only have been better if the grandparents could have joined us . even my nearly year old grandmother joined us amazing
hi there just a quick post today to share my projects with this month 's le kit from my creative scrapbook . with christmas only a couple of weeks , i 'm sure you 're in the mood for some holiday crafting . you 'll love this beautiful kit which includes a wonderful mix of my mind 's eye lost found christmas and simple stories days of christmas . i really enjoyed working with it and here 's what i created ...
i believe that the driver on this black car did the only sensible thing he could have done under these circumstances . if he had stopped at the stop sign there would have been no safe way for him to enter the traffic flow , imho . as a matter of fact , i have not seen a single driver , in several hours of recent observation , who has been foolish enough to make a full stop at this stop sign .
it was sitting quietly in the corner of the living room at an estate sale , minding its own business , when it caught my eye . then i heard it calling my name . i mean , really calling me . especially with its price tag . i sat in it for about five seconds and that was long enough for me to decide that it was seriously one of the most comfortable chairs i 've ever sat in . sold .
when i met steve things were different . i knew he was a good man and he treated me well . i was in a time in my life where i felt like i was ready to get married . it was a box to check off on my life 's ' to do ' list . i do n't believe in soul mates and knew that with dedication and hard work that i could make my marriage to any man work .
yay it took me forever to decide on paint colors for the walls . i picked a dark blue a lighter teal blue . when i got them on the walls , i did n't like one of them . i thought the color that was supposed to be a lighter blue was too dark . so , i added white to it until i thought it was good . then i still hated it . oddly enough my husband liked it .
preheat over to f . pat your fish dry and sprinkle salt lightly on both sides . in a new bowl melt your butter and add panko , cheese and pepper . mix lightly with a fork . with your hands take mixture and press the mixture lightly onto the fish . bake for minutes until topping is golden and fish is firm , but not till the fish is dry . smaller pieces will be ready sooner so adjust time accordingly .
now for the good . the sights were awesome . virginia is loaded with wall to wall mountains that seem to stretch on forever . i wish i could have seen them during the day time , but even at night , they still looked pretty . maybe i was so awe struck because i do n't see stuff like this everyday . i only wish i had a camera the image above is one i pulled off the google search engine .
i know , rice stuff is nt a very good name for a recipe . but i made this last night and when we said our usual dinner prayer come lord jesus , be our guest , and let this to us be blessed in which the blank is the specific dish we are having for dinner , my son and husband both filled in the blank with rice stuff . this was then followed by , mmmmmm , i love rice stuff
it has been a while since i posted about making jam . i posted here and here of my previous marathon . well , it has been a while since i made any . our stash was low . we were down to a case and a half in the stockpile and christmas is coming . since i started giving jam for christmas gifts , it has come to be expected and what we had left was not going to do it .
if you are more of a just do it kind of person , though , check out t shirt surgery . this is a live journal community of people who reconstruct clothes , often t shirts or thrift store finds . what they lack in knowledge , they make up for in imagination . they proudly show off their creations , and some of them look really , really good . i would wear them , and my clothing is pretty conservative .
i 'm on a laundry strike this week . i have actually not washed a load all week . i had the kids bring their dirty clothes into the laundry room last night and just stared at them . not really . i had good intentions of starting washing but i was exhausted from a full week back to work , taking kids to school dance classes , midweek church , i could n't face it . how often do you do laundry
the photos are from a hike that my youngest daughter and i would make on occasion just se of boise , id . we loved walking there , especially in the spring and fall . the scenery was amazing , and there is such diversity in the rock and ground there . even though one might consider boise to be in the middle of a desert , it can be quite beautiful and even green for a few months of the year .
bring water to a boil . add the eggs and bring back to a boil . once the water is boiling , reduce it to a simmer . cook for a total of five minutes for large eggs . remove eggs from the pot and add to ice cold water . once the eggs are cool enough to hold , crack open with a knife , and scoop the egg out of the shell . sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste .
things are good here , but busy . i 'm enjoying the new job , and getting more used to it . i think it 's something i 'll be good at once i figure out how to do all steps for writing insurance policies on the computer without stopping to ask someone what to do next . customers do n't really like it when you do that , just in case you were wondering . back soon with hopefully more photos .
i had an extremely stressful senior year of high school , when i actually thought there was only one college in the whole world for me . i went to college loving math , but not knowing if i wanted to major in it . it seemed like it might be too hard . and i had trained myself not to try things that i might not be awesome at when it came to academics . i needed to be the best .
i hope you know how much i love you . it 's more than anyone could imagine . i miss you so very much . i wish more than anything i could be holding you in my arms but i 'll have to settle with keeping you forever in my heart . you each represent a special time in my life . though it was short , those times will always belong to you . you 'll always be my baby boys .
so , now my therapist want me to remember what made me want to be a girl . i said that i really does n't think that someone made me think like that . and she think that i need to know when this started to do the family session i was hoping for . i know now that in brazil there is not right age for hormones and no right time to therapy before hormones , it depends on the therapist .
i know it looks a bit odd that i filled from the bottom to top , but there 's a good reason for it . my chair that i sit in , wheels over to the shelf , and i wanted the markers i used the most which was my blue colors to be closest to me when i wheeled over . so i filled it bottom to top . and i put my studio color chart on top for handy reference .
father s day gifts can be a tricky proposition . fortunately , most men have similar basic needs and wants that do nt change much , regardless of their age or situation . this father s day gift buying guide will help you figure out how to buy a father s day gift that will tell dear old dad that you care specifically , that you care enough to think about what he would really like to receive on father s day .
yesterday , after santa was done talking to that other kid and he was about to see his next little ones santa asked if he knew why we celebrate christmas . i 'm not sure if santa asks every child this or not but i loved that other kid 's response we celebrate christmas because it 's jesus ' birthday that warmed my heart and made me thankful for the privilege of being his mom indeed jesus is the reason for the season
this site is not a propaganda site for nick griffin . this site is for the benefit of the british national party and all her members . its also here for race and nation . when the chairman of the british national party does well he will get rewarded with good write ups here , likewise when things are not going so well as things are now , then likewise we would like the problems addressed as we are writing about here .
what i like about the book is that it is built to be used in everyday life . she has scripted various phrases that you would use in your normal speaking what clothes will you wear , meal time phrases , play time , etc . so you learn the phrases and practice them as you are doing that activity . there are also some fun games at the end of the book that help them remember the words they have learned .
trick is you just need to sit down and start it . if you are having problems search online on tips of how to start that aspect or start using note pads to come up with your plan of action . this takes sometime , but if you can go into your project with a giant idea of who you want it to work look , then all you need to do is figure out the base which is the starting point .
i had a tough choice to make , and after talking with my wife decided on the more long term job . i do n't mind too much , i get to see my kids everyday , i enjoy being home , i was able to experience this awesome nw hot summer but i still have a lot of regret . i was handed my dream job , and literally the kind of experience that i dream about . it was amazing .
i 've officially gone crazy . altogether i 've spent hours working this summer . and to top it off , i 'm not even done yet . now i do n't want to complain , no one forced me to work this much but myself . i 'm just so fed up , that going back to school in a couple of weeks actually feels like a vacation . i guess you just have to learn how to enjoy the little things ,
i think this is going to be a long post the craft room is pretty much done , so i thought i 'd show you how it 's looking now . just needs a few finishing touches , and there may be some rearranging done as i see how the layout works , but at long last i have everything to hand and space to work . space what luxury this was my room in the old house , barely feet by feet .
so remember when i was talking about wanting to make my own floor mirror and i made sean carry discarded wood down our street well , this weekend we finally got to work on it . it s not entirely finished because i need to figure out how to hold the mirror part in place , but i was too excited to wait , and i thought you all might have some ideas for what i should use to keep the mirror attached .
second , i guess i wanted to show the shopping public how much work we put into things that do n't pan out in order for us to have a collection that does appeal . what you do n't see are all the mistakes , false starts and huge investments of time and resources into dead end ideas . making things for a living is hard figuring out what people want to buy that we also want to make is a constant struggle .
sure , there were things that we never fully got used to being the school girls we were raised to be but even those somehow shocking stuff were less and less disturbing after a while . or rather some of us found ways to avoid looking at what we do nt want to see or not to think about what we do nt want to think about . we learned to be girls scouts and know how to work around a potential problem .
but yesterday , i hit up my local salvation army on the way home from a meeting and took advantage of half priced day . even though the weather keeps going back and forth between winter and summer here , there are some spring trends that i am really looking forward to . i walked in to the store thinking of a few things horizontal stripes , bold colors , printed pants , and walked out with a major haul , all for about
well . it 's been a long time since i have had the chance to defend my position biblically . it was quite refreshing it 's something i 've missed since leaving bible college . it challenges me to re think my position , to make sure i am taking the bible in context , and then , to explain it properly . i hope i did nt step on two many toes , but i wo nt apologize for what i believe .
the church porch vigil is something i have still to experience , after all everyone s experience and explanation of such events is different . perhaps someone up there was telling me i had already got enough on my plate for now or perhaps someone up there was just having a bloody good laugh at my expense . either way i could do nothing but hold my hands up , surrender and admit defeat and see the funny side there s always next year
there are some things that you learn in college that you will use for the rest of your life . yet , they may not be things that you would learn from a class that you are taking . these life skills will help you when it 's time for you to start your career , and even get a job . there are plenty of things that you can take away from the classroom besides the lessons that are on the syllabus .
i left the house at am and arrived back home at pm . only to almost literally throw clothes on the girls so they could hop in the van and go back with me by pm . m had to go do a side job , and there was a baby shower for a coworker at the branch . so the girls came with me . oh , and i still had nt eaten my breakfast apple i took with me at am .
prayer lord , it is my hope that you will supply me with the grace necessary to follow through with the call that brings me great joy in my heart and rest in the knowledge that you will show me the way to follow your will in this and every decision i make in my life . i ask this , as always , in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy spirit . amen .
a huge , huge love is that this palette comes complete with the three little how to cards that give you ideas on how to use each line . of course , you do n't have to use them this way , but it makes for a nice and easy eye that you do n't have to think about . plus , i do n't have to type out what i did for each look , because you can just read the card lol
i live so close to all of these great places in ireland but i just never seem to make the time to go and see them so i decided that it was finally time to start checking them off my list . and believe it or not , james has n't been to most of these places either .... i ca n't believe that someone could live somewhere their entire life and never go and see some of these great sights in the country
we ve been making lots of things lately . i do nt know if it s the time of the year , the weather , or having missed the pre holiday making by being in india and getting ready to travel back home . or maybe it s all of it . but i think for us has been that now we are home with all of our tools and supplies and we are excited we can make things any time we want to
what about the man who was lowered on a bed into a crowded house it was obvious he needed to be able to walk again but jesus saw deeper than that . what he needed was forgiveness of sins , a way out of the mess his life was in son , your sins are forgiven . so when he took up his bed and walked , the healed man walked with his head held high into a new story full of possibilities .
as our time drew near to leave sundrawoti , the time also drew near to take a lot of group pictures by which to remember all the friends we d be leaving behind . in my experience , the problem with being in a picture is that i tend to not be the one taking it . the problem is worse in a country where the average person i ask to take a picture may easily be doing so for the first time .
now . on monday morning , from the moment you leave your home , walk with awareness . really look around , at the land , the creatures , your fellow workers . forget the mp player , even the book on the train or bus . look around . see the land you walk through , natural and man made . do nt judge , just bear witness . consider how you move within it . let your spirituality inform your actions .
the new plan makes sense , and gives me something to spend the money for the work i 'm currently doing on . it 'll involve a bit more travel , and it 'll involve spending more time here . if i wind up finding a place , i might even not have to eat the extra rent a friend of mine in italy has expressed interest in coming here , and i could toss the place to him for the remaining time .
i think my problem comes down to the way i view language as a tool . for me , language is the means by which we tell stories and by which we think and have ideas . but , to me , language has no beauty in itself . you could write the most beautiful , flowing sentence in the world but unless it evoked a gorgeous image or helped to further along a beautiful story , i just do nt see it .
answers . i can explain how that works for me . with one exception , my prayers are answered this way i seek guidance . i get no guidance . i make a decision on my own . i take action and then and only then do i discover if i made the right decision . i get a feeling of confirmation or an overwhelming feeling of no do nt do that . that is if i am paying attention , and listen .
he said , take these outside , put them in the trunk of a close cab and wait in it , when i come out , i ll find you , wait till i am at the cab and get out , get your car and follow me to the hotel , take my bags from my cab , wait one hour and drop them off at the front desk , say you are from the airport , give them apologies or something .
i was a bit annoyed and i stayed in my room i started to get dressed again , they all went into the family room which was outside of my room , so i could not leave the room without being seen and so i stayed in my room somewhat annoyed i still wanted to take a bath , and i wondered why they came over my guess was that maybe they wanted to sell something or maybe they wanted some money or something .
the concept is very simple . mail a birthday card and a dollar bill for a senior who is having a birthday for that month . since most are over years old , it is my goal that they at least receive a dollar and a card for each year of their life . how fun and special this will be , and certainly make their day . what a great way to let them know someone is thinking about them and they are important
to honor love this month , i am running all of my love , the greatest of these products at a reduced price for the entire month of february . be sure and take advantage of the sale . if you are interested in all of it , buy the bundle which is off of what you would normally spend on every product here is the link to see all of them in the store . the previews follow below but are not linked .
so today i got to practice what is called , in ocd treatment , an exposure . that means dealing with something that makes me anxious and check y in this case , i got distracted by work and was unable to complete something that s generally supposed to be finished at the end of the week . by the time i found out , none of the people who could help fix it were available . there was literally nothing i could do .
my head is well and truly spinning with the amount of stuff i still have to do . i have one more work shift to force myself through before i can truly put my mind to nothing but our vacation , but my head is a little ahead of the game . yesterdays shift was tough , today is going to be near impossible . thankfully we do nt leave until late afternoon tomorrow , so i will have time to get stuff done .
it has been a few days since my last post . i have been busy coming up with new product ideas . i decided that now is the time to offer a giveaway . the winner will receive discount on any piece of art in my shop or a custom made piece . shipping is free . you can get a piece like this one in the size and color of your choice . visit my shop to see the rest of my work .
so i was supposed to be in court at am , and it was already on account of me being late . and not only did i have to make it to court , but i also had to go meet the police officer who decided to wait until the same goddamn day as court to tell me i had to be there and then act like i was doing something wrong by not being home between the hours of and monday through friday .
god prepared the good works which we were to do before we even took a breath . that verse became so comforting to me when i realised that the things that had happened around me were not from pure misfortune . god places us where he wants us because he has prepared what we are to do for his glory . there is no need to fear for the future or to doubt your circumstances as god has built his will up around you .
one of the things that gets me excited about baking is when someone asked me to bake something for their special occasion , especially for a wedding . at first , the thought of baking hundreds of macarons with my schedule sounds really impossible and each time , i just ca n't say no for most of them . there is something about wedding that is just so magical and being asked to be a part of that is such an honor for me .
do you ever have conversations in your head with someone the other day , imaginary drew was asking me which of my parents was my favorite . this may be an actual conversation that s happened out loud at some point . i thought i would have an answer for imaginary drew i do nt like getting into fake conversations when i do nt know exactly what my platform is , but it turned out i had no idea which is my favorite parent .
what if you were to lose your job tomorrow what if one of your kids suddenly died without reason what if it was your parents or grandchildren how would you handle that would you be able to make it through the day if you are like me , you are probably having a hard time answering that question . the what if scenario can drive people to madness . at the same time , we also must be able to answer these questions confidently .
firstly , it is extremely unlikely that this is the first time that this individual was involved in acts of that kind . grown people do not just change their behaviour in a few months time , we all know that . my point being that this episode calls into question the screening which is carried out in relation to these appointments . whatever screening processes now exist , will definitely have to be made stronger , together with ongoing reviews of board performance .
today , i woke up at noon . something i never do , because i think sleeping away at least four hours of your life in the morning , when you could be doing something productive , is a waste . when you could just do that sleeping at night instead of staring into space and letting thoughts eat at your brain . but i guess that 's hypocritical of me to say , because that 's exactly what i do . oh well .
everyone has a beastie boys story , do n't they no it 's never good when anyone only dies of cancer , but i have to say that the band left a very light impression on me . except for the time i rode in the same el car as a number of beastie boys fans . it was a fairly crowded car , but they stood out . how do i know they were beastie boys fans they were n't shy about it .
maybe you 'll make some homemade gifts this year maybe you wo n't . but if making everything just right comes at the price of missing time with family or even worse becoming grinchy toward your loved ones , then it 's time to throw in the towel . i 'm totally preaching to myself here . i wish i could say i 'm just a pleasure to be around all of the time , but that 's not the truth . especially today .
i recently had an interesting conversation with a gentleman regarding his family . during the conversation he mentioned that his son has been attending college for about years . i asked about his major thinking maybe he was studying for a master s degree or more . the gentleman seemed a little upset and stated , he has nt settled on one yet . at this point the gentleman said that he was worried his son may become a perpetual student and never graduate .
and , yeah , there 's a do n't try this at home , kids warning toward the end , but seriously , you should totally try this at home . ok , i do n't mean you should train your peers to shun someone , but if you 're having trouble getting your kids to focus on their homework or you want your boyfriend to take out the trash , then you should definitely try applying some dog training techniques . it works .
and many of you guys know about the white house kitchen garden . we re going to go down there and harvest with our kids in a few minutes . but i still remember last year when we started the whole process , and we involved kids from local schools from the very beginning . they helped us till the soil . they helped us plant . they helped us weed . they helped us harvest . they ate . it was pretty powerful .
this is an easy one to get started with . this non profit exists to spread usage of social media . but notice that they directly tie this social media goal to a specific non social media goal to improve the quality , access , value and effectiveness of healthcare delivery to patients . in other words , the organization does nt just want to spread social media usage for its own sake it wants to do so to achieve a real world goal .
yet this is also just a sign of wanting things to go smoothly . you actually put time and effort into making sure you have a great time because after all , life is short . some dates can be long and boring . and if in fact this date turns out to be the first of many and blossoms into an actual commitment , you will one day smile upon this memory of trying so very , very hard for this awesome human being .
at almost , however , the pumpkin starts to get so upset when we tell her she ca n't have something , but then i hold up a finger and say , hey , hey , hey do n't you want to hear why you ca n't do it and she stops freaking out , asks to hear why , and then usually understands the reason and is either okay with it or comes up with a compromise or something that works for us all .
i 'm not boasting about this , please know . for many years , grandma was too far away to be able to help out the way i always dreamed it would be . and we had an awesome church family to rely on , a family who always came through for us . but in the back of my mind , i always imagined how it would be to have my mom close by , close enough to call on when i needed her .
my group was broken into several teams including media planning , research , and creative . i was part of the creative team which handles all design and production of the ads and other materials that the viewer will ultimately interact with . while the other teams in the group are equally important to the success of the project as a whole , i am going to going to focus almost exclusively on the creative aspect of the campaign in this , and future posts .
as it turns out , the shows were a great success , the music was completely over the top and the crowd basically freaked out . everyone in the band wanted to do more so we decided on a week american tour starting in october that same year . it turned out to be the most rewarding experience of our musical career . i do nt think we played a bad show the whole tour the piece band sounded like a landing on your house .
when asked to a white person , this question is met with confusion . but for me , it s an inquiry about my race . no one had to tell me , even as a child , that what are you meant what race are you i just knew . my answer used to be , i m mixed , which would raise other questions about what i was mixed with and how much of it . mixed was never a good enough answer .
as odd as this might sound , i 'm going to say my children . being a young mother , i was somewhat forced to become responsible and selfless . they made my life matter and focused my attention on something much bigger . they have shown me what is important in life and have taught me not to take a single day for granted . i hope to be the type of person who is fun loving and easy going just like my kids .
if you 'd truly intended to help or improve your future daughter in law , you know there are a dozen different better ways to have approached the perceived flaws in her character . no , this email was intended to hurt her and to make yourself feel better , plain and simple . as such , you are the one who should pull the stick out of your arse and apologize to the lady in question , as well as to your step son .
much measuring ensued at this point . can the crib and changing table the green cabinet in that first picture both fit beyond this unit yes , but not well . and that does nt feel right anyway . the more i thought about it , and the foot paper storage desk i want to put in the studio , the more i realized the only real solution is to flip sides nursery to the right , studio to the left . move all of this
in australia , where i live , both main political groups embrace market driven economics namely the liberal national parties , the main conservative political group , and the labor party , which , although losing many voters to the greens , is still the main left of centre party . or perhaps we should say , the main nominally left of centre party . because if there is no difference in the economics on both sides , then is there any real difference at all
wow , it 's been a week and a half and i am quite glad to have a whole day where i have nothing planned and nothing specific to do aside from the usual house stuff that is you see , a few months ago , i decided that i was in danger of digging my rut deeper and deeper and not doing anything to climb out of it and so i began to find other things to do , not to mention people to meet
the sound of music is the first movie that i remember watching . i was young , but i remember being very excited about it . even today , it is one of those films that just does n't get old for me . granted i 've not watched it in years , but in some ways i 've watched it so many times i could play it inside my own head . i suspect though , that i have far better things to do .
the only aspect of this that was challenging for me , was the wait time , between steps . i am the gal who wants to have a recipe on the table in a half an hour . one evening , i made the dough and divided it , into two packages . into the fridge , it went . the next morning , i was raring to go and something came up and i had to ignore that dough that was screaming for attention .
okay , someone sent this to me in an email and labeled it bucket list . since a bucket list is supposed to be a list of things i want to do before i die , this list does n't qualify . but it is fun to see what people have experienced . so i put an x by everything i 've done . feel free to copy , answer a few in comments , or whatever to tell me which things you 've done .
and remember my sewing stand turned into a table i 'm so glad that i sold it because as much as i loved it , it was a pain in the you know what to haul around very heavy and it took up so much room in our vehicle . and the lady who purchased it was so excited . she told me that she had a room in her house completely devoted to local artists , and this is where this table was going .
overall , i 'm very happy with the results . i was lucky enough not to have anything go terribly wrong . the only part that i would like to have done differently is the piping . it 's amazing that i 've practiced the piping around the cake plate times , and never once did i have so many issues until today . it ended up coming out well , but it 's a little frustrating to think that i could have done better .
everyone may think the teen years start and end at a certain age . i say the teen years start at age and go until around years old . then again the young adult could be to years old . that may just be me . and now i feel i have to go over this . there s baby , toddler , child , and kid which everyone probably knows what they are . i believe a tween is and years old . just saying .
i m beginning to learn that i write best or get more done when i m able to write early in the morning . there s an hour to two hour period where bagpiper has already left for work and cupcake is still asleep that s just perfect for writing . unfortunately , i really hate waking up early , so i m still trying to adjust to attempting to be up at am every day . some days it works , others it does nt .
we can not control everything that happens in this world , but we can make the best of what we have been given . let life run its course , as it is going to , but in the process of doing so , live it to the fullest . do everything you want , and achieve all that you wish to accomplish . who knows where fate or life may take us tomorrow , so for today , you might at well enjoy the ride .
as a result of stitching this over the weekend , i have realised that i can only stitch for an hour or two at a time now any more hurts my hands and requires a longer rest . therefore , it is going to take me a lot longer to complete projects than i had originally anticipated . ok , so i stitched this in less time than the magazine estimated i would , but i need to allow a larger time frame for special events .
during my quiet time i am studying the different women of the bible . i got a book of devotionals and such from a sweet lady at my church right after i graduated high school . i 've started and stopped this book several times . i always come back to it , because it 's fascinating to study these women and to see what role they had . it 's also refreshing to be able to relate to them somehow and to learn from them .
so , this is my prayer today that the kingdom of god come upon you and fills your spirit , souls , minds , body and your hearts with his love , joy , peace and his power in the name of our lord and savior jesus christ . if you have not received him into your heart , you can welcome and receive him into your heart , who loves all the people of the world . may the kingdom of god come upon you .
mind you i still do nt know what that privilege is . one time when i was young and very poor i was late on my light bill . i showed the electric company my balls , but they cut my power off anyway . maybe they were nt big enough , since i am an mra and all , but it did nt even buy me one minute past the deadline . i was male powerful , but i had no power . go figure .
then the crowd said to him , lord , you must always give us this bread . and he answered them , i am the bread of life the one who comes to me would not hunger , and the one who believes in me will not ever thirst . but i have said to you that you have seen me and you do not believe . they still did not trust him and he knew it . they refused to trust him with their sin .
the classes start at in the morning , and while it means i have to get up and out of the house way earlier than normal , i love it . i think it 's something every teacher should do , at least a few times . most of the time , we english teachers have a good life here in the rok and it treats us pretty well . it 's only fair to give something back above and beyond what our jobs call for .
well , i 've been thinking and contemplating what really happened to send me to the hospital again . i try so hard to maintain at home and i do n't like to have to visit the er to get myself taken care of , but i think i 've come to the realization now that i do what i have to do . it basically comes down to the point where i ca n't maintain myself anymore or feel like things are out of control .
i had mentioned on my last post i was taking some time off to look for my next signpost to guide me to get to where i need to be , since then i have found many , and many have helped , and i thank you all . when all seems lost and nothing seems right it 's good to know that christ our savior is always there to get us through , peter , some verses i found when i really needed them most .
do n't you deserve to feel that way too do n't you want to have that feeling of accomplishment that comes with having just poured your sweat , time and effort into making your body stronger , lean and powerful get out there make today your day to commit mins to your body . you 'll be glad you did . you 'll be proud of yourself . you 'll realize that it 's not that hard and maybe you 'll choose to do it tomorrow too
if they re looking for the female that will offer them the world , put up with their bullshit , love them when they least deserve it , wipe their tears , help build their blocks up when the world knocks em down and learn how to put herself last just so she can be there when he needs to come first well i ca nt help them . but for him for him i can , was and wanted to be all that and more .
when you get to the going to be published phase of this whole writing journey , people constantly ask for advice both writers and non writers . which is fine . i like giving advice actually , though i usually pad it with a lot of disclaimers about how every path is different and you have to find what works for you . but what 's interesting is that my advice is always changing , mostly based on what i 'm going through at the time .
being aware of what is behind you or inside of you gives you the chance to create your vision of success . once you have decided the change you want to be and create then be conscious of doing so . if nothing else be conscious of creating a single change within you each day , see how things are different then create another change until you reach your vision of success . if nothing changes within you then nothing changes in what you are manifesting .
remember that when you finish a project off you want who ever receives it to be able to enjoy it for a long time . whether it 's just for friends or family or for clients who purchase your crocheted goods . that is a another reason why it 's so important to make sure your item is finished correctly . you do n't want an unhappy customer . you want them to come back time , after time and tell others about your quality work .
i 've come to know a few things about this life , as most chicken wives do . we may be the only demographic in the world that finds it completely normal to hear our husbands talk daily about breasts , legs , and young , tender meat and answer strange phone calls in the middle of the night all the while knowing they are in fact not cheating on us . so , how can you spot a chicken wife from the rest of the crowd
right now , i m trying to change this attitude because it causes unnecessary stress . i m trying to convince myself that it s ok to get these scores and you should nt compare yourself to anyone . you should just try harder and improve the next time . and if you did yet you still did nt get a better grade well it s fine as long as you like what you re doing . it s all about the climb as they say .
john is known for his enthusiasm , and always puts out a maximum effort to get involvement from other team members . john sees the project resulting in a high level of both corporate and customer approval . john s approach to bill is on the assumption that bill is driven to want the same things . john thinks everybody should want the same things he does . no matter how much john would want it to be that way , it just is nt true .
once again i will be on vacation during the month of may. this means that i will be away for my youngest daughter s birthday . this is not the first time i missed my daughter susan s birthday . in fact i have missed it a few times before . it does make me feel bad but it is the best time to go on vacation . if i start my vacation in the spring before the schools close the sites are much less crowded .
we were talking about that . both of us wondered why she does n't try being honest with her mother . chamille said that it was n't going to change anything , that she would n't get her life back , and she still would n't be able to see her , even if her mom let her come back home from the bad kid reform ranch school . the lack of honest communication is part of what caused all this stuff in the first place .
preheat oven to degrees f degrees c . lightly grease an x square baking dish . combine the black beans , eggs , oil , cocoa powder , salt , vanilla extract and sugar in a blender blend until smooth pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish . sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mixture . bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan , about minutes .
for my money the meet of the year . i m sure there will be some that agree , and those that have their own ideas . so i ve put up a poll at the top of the page where you can register your votes for the meet you feel was the best of . and feel free to leave comments as i m curious as to how you viewed this year s meets . especially with the diamond league in it s first season .
i have decided to move on to another agency . long story short i have lots of agents who were chomping at the bit to work with my book proposal . i went with one , it did n't work out , a year later i have decided to move on and go with another agent . one agent told me she would need a list of the submissions and responses . i 'd like to have that list too , just for my own records .
the first time a student asked me that question , it took me a while to figure out what , exactly , he was asking me . eventually i realized he was asking me why i , an adult , would read books written for middle grade readers . that was answered easily enough . middle grade books are fun at least the middle grade books i like to read are . they have plot . things happen in them . the characters have amazing adventures .
the handwritten text is a rule i almost always do it , and i ca n't escape my thoughts . one key to understanding the text is that it 's usually like you said , amy , it 's like a family album it tells us why a picture was taken at that exact moment , it tells what was thought to be the story 's end at that moment or other key fact that was in our minds when i came to make a picture .
then you have several sections that are organized by dairy , nuts , snacks , frozen and so on . of course , these areas do n't have everything that you may purchase but the note section allows you write the items down that are not already listed . not only is the supermarket smarty used for food but there are also sections for cleaning , personal care , pets and more . this really allows you to do your whole shopping trip in one with ease .
here are the instructions . i made a lot of mistakes along the way , and burned my fingers a few times . dollar items do n't give great instructions . so hopefully if you make them too , then you can learn from my mistakes i did the ghost first , frankenstein nd , and witch rd , so i took pics of the last one i did . also , i do n't know if using a glue gun was the best idea for this .
we were talking about balance , in life , in relationships , in nature , i suppose , and i was at a loss for another word to describe this precarious walk of life , of finding a lid to fit your pot yes , i also stole that too , but this time from a book and i 'm not telling you which one so you 'll spend all of your free time wondering how you can find your own gems stolen gems , that is .
well , it could , you think to yourself , if your best friends from home were here too . you wonder what they re up to right now . dad would have found the building really interesting and mum , well mum would have definitely laughed when she heard what your crazy neighbour said this morning about oh , what was it you do nt even remember anymore , it was hilarious at the time though , just like when you all took that family trip to
so lee is giving himself a well deserved pat on the back for planning this trip to paris . our hotel is awesome , and about a or minute walk from the arc de triomphe if you know which direction to go . we 've walked all over paris for the last couple days and we 've seen some amazing things , so lots of wonderful pictures when we get back . but here 's just a few from our first two days to make you jealous .
i m not quite sure where to go from here . whether or not to put it to one side for a short time again risking the possibility i may never come back to it or to force myself into it and simply be stronger , more focused , more dedicated . looking at those two options on the page i know which i d rather be known for doing . after all is it better to try and fail , or to never have tried at all
so , i know that i have to give up things i like to do , things i enjoy , but the hardest thing to do is give up your family . everyday it is a fight to even out my time with my family and my studies . i know that in a year and a half i will be out of school . i will be able to give them the time they deserve when i am home . truly ca n't wait for that day
this was one of the first christmas songs that i learned to play on the piano when i was in kindergarten or first grade . it was already my favorite christmas carol at that time , but now it will always hold a special place in my heart . as a little girl , i was absolutely obsessed with the nativity , baby jesus in particular . we could not pass a nativity scene without me having to stop and stare at it for the longest time .
céline yelling . you know , i want to kill them why did nt they ask me to marry them i would have said no , but at least they could have asked but it s my fault , i know it s my fault , because i never felt it was the right man . never but what does it mean the right man the love of your life the concept is absurd the idea that we can only be complete with another person is evil right
it was quite strange being the only customer seated , with only other people coming in to buy a cup of coffee or some cakes to go . but i guess i can somewhat blame the time of day .. yes , let s blame it on the time . i was there at around .. so students were just getting off school and people were still at work .. we ll let this one pass . it definitely does nt reflect their products in my opinion .
i mean , we waste so much energy worrying about it even before it happens . a year old woman catching up with her friend of the same age should be talking fun and happy stuff you d think . or exciting stuff which lets your knowledge grow . but all she wanted to speak was about my marriage . how come our parents have not tried doing a drastic drama to control us , how can i trust a man like that , and so on .
in this day and age , i have nt seen a lot of truly passionate individuals . gifted yes , driven yes , but passionate well today was one of those days . i met a man , a father of two , who was so truly passionate about my wedding , more so than even some of my friends who was this man all will be revealed in another post . for specific reasons , i can not tell all that i would like to just yet
you have been wonderful and you let me in . i felt it a ... do n't write it off . do n't reduce us to just something of the past that you want to get over as soon as possible . i know how you can shut off . you told me and i 've seen you do it . i could probably do something about that if i were there . but then we might not be facing this , if that were the case .
the book is about the lives of some of the ladies who have achieved the impossible in the indian corporate world . the stories are not boring biographies but an insight into the minds and souls of these women who worked hard to achieve what they did , the motivation , inspiration and self belief that kept them going in a society that has always looked down upon women , in a society where women have to fight for their rights and their place under the sun .
i bold words and ideas i consider important , and doing so can drastically change the meaning of words and sentences . this is a trick i learned from reading comic books . observe the following . what is the difference when i say , you do nt have to from , you do nt have to the former statement can be taken as is , but the latter raises further questions . have or need or want that emphasis also adds some color to the sentence .
there really is n't much to the challenge , but it 's not easy . you log all of your food , make sure you eat a green veggie each day , cut out the sugar read labels to make sure and do at least minutes of exercise each day . see , not bad , but today i had the worst headache . from the lack of sugar , perhaps i really did n't think i had that much sugar in my diet . interesting , huh
today was such a day . immediately after entering the building , i asked a young man if he could speak with me for a moment . i issued him a huge challenge . i asked him to add another one hour meeting to his week , to commit to reading chapters of scripture each week and then to meeting with me for a time of prayer , discussion of what we 'd read and then a series of heavy accountability questions . he immediately said yes .
if the lord cares about the details of our lives like our luggage being lost , how much more he cares for each of the little ones who are lost from their families . he brought lydia into our lives and we do n't know all the details of how he worked things out for us to be together . we do n't have to know everything , but he does and he is already there at the end of our lives knowing how the pieces fit together .
if it had nt been for the child then none of this might have happened , but the fact that a child was involved made everything that much harder to forgive . not that there is anything to forgive , of course , but the fact that a child was mixed up in it all made us feel that there was no going back that it mattered . the fact that a child was affected meant we had to face ourselves properly , we had to follow through .
so , the next time that you fail at something , especially if it is in your walk with god , remember that he is perfect so that those who follow him never have to be while still on this earth . be blessed that you have the ability to know what failure is , but how sweet redemption will be in the end of all things . if our god is for us , then there is no defeat , and no loss . there is only triumph
this is what we ended up with clear definition of the two spaces , the ability to walk into the dining area from either side , we were easily able to add one of the table leaves with plenty of room to add the other if we have company , and no need for new furniture . it was a little hard to get used to at first , but as the weekend went on and as we added some new items , we fell in love with it
even if your not a fan of science fiction , or fantasy for that matter , i m positive you ll love this book anyway . because when it comes to the actual story , it s just a kid who s had a rough life that s trying to fit in . it s also a story about growing up , about making mistakes and learning from them , about friendship , a first love , trying to figure out who you are . it s everything .
i have a huge head so i know to sit low . people with big heads that have nt figured this out yet should be in prison . if it s the hair that s making the head in front of you so big , just trim some of it off with a pair of scissors . it s dark , and they wo nt notice what you 've done to them until they get home . by that time , you re already half way to mexico .
so , now i have this internal struggle that i hate having . on one hand , i believe that i 'm beautiful just as i am and fuck you if you do n't think so . on the other hand , i 'm in crap shape , and at , i 'm not getting any younger . the older i get the harder it will be to lose the excess baggage , and i know deep in my heart of hearts that i need to get healthier .
you are right . it is ironic how all those times that we were there , going to same malls , eating at same restaurants , maybe doing some same things , we never met . ironic how we had to know each other here . and god gave you to me right when everything was almost settled . may sound weird but yeah , everything was in good timing . certainly not perfect , we know that , but the god was indeed strategic with his timing .
. how do you encourage each other in the marriage show me a man that is encouraged by his wife who thinks he can do anything , and i will show you man that can conquer the world . on the flip side , show me a woman who is not lifted up by her husband , and i will show you a woman who is defeated . christ has got to be the center of your encouragement in your marriage for your marriage to make it . period
in my heart i feel you everyday and i know you are going to watch over your little sister and that means the world to me . i am going to tell her what a wonderful and special big sister she has and how lucky she and how i wish she could have met you baby i am so sorry , i am so so sorry for what as happened to you . i love you with all that i am and all that i will be love mommy
in i felt thankful that i could even finish but this year i was not content with just dragging across the line . i led the first mile , which felt awesome , but secretly i knew i could nt keep that pace . during the second mile women slipped past me , but that was all . not the pace i was hoping for , but having recovered from a hip problem in march when i could nt train at all i probably should nt really complain .
when the fireworks were over , everyone stood up and began the long walk back to wherever they were living that night . some undoubtedly went to their hotel and others went back to their house . maybe some went to their cars and others went a walking like us . it could be that others went to nowhere as they had nowhere to go or back to their box under a bridge . but for those minutes at point state park , we were altogether one people .
i did a little research and found that you can still get these but the price is higher . target has them for the lowest price , around online but i d call before heading out to your local store to make sure they carry them and that the price is good . they were at other stores online like walmart . or wait for a yard sale , for some reason people like to get rid of these , little do they know how handy they can be
now that i 've lived on a farm for years , i start to go a little stir crazy if i do n't get outside every couple of hours . what 's nice is that no matter what the weather , there 's always some good reason to leave the kitchen or computer and head out into the fresh air , even if it 's only for five minutes to empty the kitchen compost container , feed some scraps to the chickens , or just hug a sheep .
oh yeah , just sharing . i have this boss actually he s my boss boss and well he loves the series in fact we watch the same set of series we talk about how i met your mother every monday shift in fact i try to go to work a bit earlier just to talk about this . we compare observations and speculations etc . amazing right he s awesome , seriously , how many of you can actually say that you boss is as cool as mine
entertainment has become something that s blurred when it comes to when and where you can enjoy it . at some distant time in the past , if you were not at home or in your car , you had no real choice of entertainment . naturally , you could always just enjoy the great outdoors , although for arguments sake we will only refer to entertainment as music and media . you would watch television at home and listen to music in your car or at home .
once your dough has risen , it needs a second rise . punch it down and split into two even balls of dough . grease a inch springform pan and spread one dough ball into the bottom of it , making sure you 've covered it evenly . spread onion and sausage mixture on top and then cover with the second ball of dough , spread out into a disc . cover and let rise for minutes . this is a good time to preheat your oven to degrees
turns out the guy who is a regular and requested me complained to the manager that i provided them with the worst service ever . because they ran out of water and his buddy had to get his third and fourth drink from the bar . i could n't believe this . everything had seemed fine . i thought he must have been joking . i checked the money they left . twenty bucks on . and he told the host stand specifically that his tip reflected the service .
so please now your numbers , know your family medical history . my mother made sure me and my sister knew ours and i 'm going to make sure my boys know theirs . it 's our first defense in helping ourselves stay healthy remember , talk to your family and find out your numbers , i know many of you have little ones to think of . we need to stay healthy for them now go and have that talk , you 'll feel better that you did .
mind you , in crafty blogland , we need to be preparing ourselves , do n't we there are not only cards to make , but there are packaging projects and gift projects and general all round making of beautiful things . so , i 've started i 've begun my christmas cards and i must say , i 've actually enjoyed making the first few . how long this will last , i do n't know , but at least i 've started in the right frame of mind
it took me everything in my power not to cry as i listened . maeve was in my arms staring at the little girl and her pillow pet . i turned and said to her , she likes your pillow pet , as she has the same one at home . her mom responded yeah , we love those pillow pets . we have a bunch , right and we always bring them with us here . the little girl smiled a small weak smile and nodded in agreement .
sight words are a great way to give a child a head start in reading . these words occur often in beginner reader books . knowing these words will eliminate the need to sound out every . single . word . help your child identify and eventually spell the following words a , at , am , and , can , i , like , me , my , no , said , see , the , to . add to this list as your child masters the words .
here s the thing , i ended up making this video using movie maker after stupid powerpoint was refusing to do things correctly . plus we spent close to five hours in the library working on it . and i still had a night class to go to , which i really did nt want to go to . we watched a movie about two jewish guys arguing . what a pointless movie core and i have a love hate relationship . it really just depends on the week .
so i tried to read up on stuff , heard from a few friends , and seemed to find out that there really was n't anything i could do about it , but i can make some changes eating differently which is going to be a challenge , not because i crave certain foods or am hooked on bad ones , just figuring out what is the better choice and exercise and hopefully be able to manage it and be just fine and little bit will be just fine .
this definitely has made me think about how i use my time . but it 's also got me thinking about how little time i really spend with organizing , cleaning , and keeping house in general . i do use my work lunch break to do a lot of planning for grocery shopping and thinking about colors and new ideas for the house and calling my dad . i 'm pretty sure i forgot some things just now , but that 's everything that i can think of .
have a look at this list of gay villages all over the world , there might be one near you . see that rainbow there in montréal , that s your flag it s how we find each other . see those people walking down that street , they re people like you . they re people like me . soon enough , you can be walking down that street . please do nt take that away from the rest of us , do nt take it away from yourself
look at the word often as used in corinthians like this you have a prescription filled and it says to take this medicine with water or food as often as you take it or when you take it . you then have to go to the directions to see how often the doctor wants you to take the pills . i believe the same applies to this verse , go to the directions given by the holy spirit on how often to eat this bread and drink this cup .
organizations large and small have , for the most part , realized the value of twitter . individuals are beginning to realize that not only can they follow their favorite celebrity , keep up with their friends , and share their daily experiences , they can also find more information on those topics relevant to their own health and where to get the care that they need . i actually follow some hospitals , health care industry topics and individuals that are significant contributors to hit healthcare information technology .
exp curve or experience curve is the rate at which this particular character will earn experience points in you game . if you click on the triple dots beside it , a new window will pop up showing you the stats for the exp curve . it will show you how many points your character will need to advance to the next level , and the second tab will show you how much experience points that character will have achieved in order to advance to any level listed here .
i started reading this book several times . i never made it through the birthday party . but this time , i was surprised , how much i liked the writing style and the story . okay , i will have to admit , i saw the movies first . it is one of my favorite movies . i thought , it was too late to read the book . i already knew the story , i already had pictures of the characters and the settings in my head .
i have smoked for years . i have been embarrassed about it for the last or years and have wanted to quit but knew i was n't ready to do it yet . on jan th i woke up and had a smoke then threw out the rest of the pack and have not looked back . today has been weeks and i am so proud of myself i have not once wanted to have a smoke and i am excited to start this new part of my life .
after a few months , i knew this was light years ahead of any other relationship i 'd had in the past . i had been in love before but never like this . after four months of dating , we took our first vacation together . belize after only six months of dating , we got an apartment together . after a year and a half of dating , we got engaged . and we were married just days before the two year anniversary of our first date .
there are levels now with jesus in the mix those who have a relationship with god who find their identity in jesus and those who have no relationship with god who find their identity in themselves . acts is telling the story of those who have a relationship with god , and god is carefully reminding them in very different ways that without jesus they are on the same level as all people . it is god through jesus who has made us who we are as the church .
this is not a bad movie . has a lot going for it . some very cool stunts and it does nt take it s self too serious . which is nice . what is wrong is the main plot . it has been done some may times before . while they try to put a new face on it and pretty it up . it still has been done . i did like the movie but only as a rent . ca nt see myself watching this again .
yes , that does seem like a good plan , but what seems reasonable , and what i can force myself to do , are two different things . i have no problem reading good novels , but i ca n't force myself to read bad ones . depending on how bad they are i may put them down after pages , or maybe . the only reason i would finish one was if i had another motive , like it being an important work or something like that .
i do hope to fit in some me time in the schedule . time to visit with my sister again , and friends who i do n't see from work or church enough . time to work on turning my hobby into a business . time to take a class or two , or maybe do some contract work . time to prepare for an epic journey with two of my best friends next may. time to volunteer , to serve my community in a different way than before .
we had planned on visiting family in upstate new york for the weekend . we expected to enjoy a lunch with one part of the family and dinner with another part of the family our routine for the last several years . this is baby girl 's first thanksgiving and we were excited for her to get to see so many family members . unfortunately our transportation fell through at the last minute , and we realized we would be spending thanksgiving on our own in new york city .
i m excited . halloween is around the corner . time for our inner children to come out and play pretend . we get to make believe that we are something , and someone that we are not . i do nt know about you , but i m a huge fan of more authentic costumes . so much so , that i generally make my own versions . also , why spend bucks on a cheesy badly made costume in a plastic bag that you ll only wear once right
as parents we can find ourselves frustrated by the lack of speed our children have in getting tasks done . when we are tired of waiting or really need something done right now , we may find ourselves saying never mind , i ll do it it often takes less time and energy to simply do it ourselves . however , when we jump in and do something our children should be doing , we are stealing the opportunity for them to increase their self discipline and sense of responsibility .
two family members recently asked me if i was still alive . they follow this blog to stay updated on my life and apparently the fact that i have n't updated this in a month leads to concern in the family about my well being . so this is just a quick update to say that yes , i 'm still alive . yes , everything is fine . no , i have n't died or fallen off the face of the earth . i 've just been really busy .
marriage definitely becomes about reminding ourselves everyday how and why we love this person . inevitably there are times when it is n't possible to resolve issues , but for the most part , a lot of the issues are silly things that if we learn to choose our battles , i say this a lot i know , but it really is true , we 'd be in a lot of a better position as a couple moving forward and coping with the day to day stress of it all
the way this job thing works is very simple . you will provide a task for a group of people called a company . this company will then , in turn , give you money so that you will not starve to death or be forced to live on the street . you will be expected to show up at this job every day and you will have to get there on time or else a person who has been deemed important will yell at you and eventually fire you .
there are so many emotions to deal with all at the same time . all of the emotions that come with a break up . and there are some major emotions and fears that come with being on my own . the point of me moving years ago was to be on my own and things happened and it did n't work out like i planned . i was prepared then . i had planned for it . i had mentally gotten myself ready . now i 'm not sure .
in reality , there is so much more to consider when answering questions than just having product knowledge . for example , consider how your customers feel after you have answered their questions . you may think you met their needs , when they still have concerns . the way you respond and the style you use when taking care of a customer affects how they perceive you and your company overall . for instance , if a customer asks you for the balance due on his account , you can
the last time i felt suicidal was in and can honestly say i do n't ever expect to feel that way again . i now have boundaries in my day to day life that stop me from going down the wrong path with people or situations that are emotionally unhealthy for me . i 've also learned how to ask for help and accept it from others . these life skills have protected me from falling back into depression at times when previously i would have been vulnerable to it .
this is , no doubt , a christopher moore book . it is his style , his voice , his humor . and yet , it 's different than his other works . it 's funny but it does n't have the same laugh out loud moments like a dirty job and lamb . but this is n't a bad thing . this may be a more serious comedy , but it 's a comedy nonetheless . and it 's a story i have a feeling will stick with me .
the small press is a wonderful resource for aspiring authors to see their work published , but if you re not careful it can also turn and bite you on the ass . as i still retain all rights to my work , my hope is to have another publisher pick my book up , dust it off , and make it available on their shelves . yes , i know i can self publish , but it just wo nt feel the same to me you know what i m saying
we had a fun day on saturday enjoying louisville post to come . later that evening , kevin s other sister and her husband called . they were visiting kevin s parents and they thought it would be a good idea for kevin to come and be with his dad the day of the surgery . originally we were not planning to be there for the surgery . we thought we would wait until she was home . so we decided that night to head north for the surgery on tuesday .
and i just checked my email and got an apology email saying he is sorry he lost his way , that he lost the person i fell in love with , that i am worth it all . i am miserable , more miserable than i was before . i want my husband back . will he ever be back to the person i need this is where i am struggling right now . is it just the wishing i hate this . hate it hate it hate it hate it .
but , before we can get into that , a word or two is needed on a few terms of bearing . using jail records to look at the relationship between race and the state requires i be clear about what i mean about those terms , and about criminality or crime as well . and , when we put those terms in to the shifting context of the period under consideration , i need to be clear that the things those terms describe change in the course of that period .
it was difficult at first . it was annoying to have to pull out a notebook and write down a sentence or two while you went about your day . it felt awkward and made me feel self conscious but by the end of the course it had become so natural . i felt naked without my notebook . two years later i still carry it around with me . i use it to write down quotes i like , ideas that come to me and books i want to read .
my idea of love is much different from most . sometimes it hurts . it hurts because when i love someone , i truly do set them free , no matter how much it might hurt me to do so . i feel very strongly that someone i love should be truly happy even if that is not with me . as much as i would love to spend every waking moment with you , i will settle for what i get because i love you and have set you free .
church was amazing it was the best service i 'd been in in a very l o n g time . it was the kind of place you 'd feel forced to assume some growth . i decided right there that i would have to visit here again . after that we all went out for lunch . by the time we got home , i was rather exhausted and took a nap , forgetting all about fretting over my husband not being there and besides , he 'd be home tonight
once upon a time there was some white fabric that was bored . she went to visit her friends , the fabric paint bottles , and asked if they could play together . they played and had fun until late that evening . the fabric was tired from all the playing , and fell asleep . when she woke up , she had changed colour to purple , black and orange . she liked that , so the next day she went to her paintstik friends , and played with them .
edit another picture of a few kids playing with one of their favorite toys . reddit , twice now , you have nearly brought me to tears . i have never felt so encouraged in my life . donations are coming in too fast to keep track , so i will update as soon as they seem to slow down . if the donations reach over , , the rest will go towards food and supplies for the children . i will absolutely keep all of you updated with the progress .
after completing screening , a person can go to the app and click on the report button . the app will automatically fill in the person s name , phone number and email address . the app asks questions such as race and name of airport , as well as the basis of the complaint , such as religion or gender . it has submit and share buttons to post on social media that a complaint was filed . the app also contains information on rights of passengers and tsa procedures .
i can and have spent entire weekends devoted only to watching one particular show , with just a few breaks in between for bathroom breaks and to stock up on food and very minimal sleep . zero human contact . sometimes i screw myself over with this habit , like last year when i decided to watch three seasons of the office the weekend before my final business paper was due . i eventually managed to cram and get my work done , so i d say it was worth it .
however , i am in no position to complain . i am almost done . i 've said it all year , but really , i can taste summer and i can smell freedom . it 's whirling towards me in slow motion , in a way that makes it seem so close to me , but so slow to arrive . but when it does arrive oh i can tell it 's going to be nothing short of sweet , and every bit worth the time it took to arrive .
i did my best to keep fighting the medical companies that continued filing to the wrong insurance , making call after to call to have them re bill and re submit . though i was already on another plan and continued telling them , they would file to the other plan that kept paying because someone in the government office had not terminated the insurance and also , i 'm sure , because it the federal insurance plan paid better . still , i kept calling and fighting the frustrating fight .
as for professional design practice , we have been doing a team project the last couple of weeks and will be doing a presentation in lesson . as for the case study we are doing , i m waiting for my contact to get back to me for the answers to my questions . i just hope the email was received since it s been slightly over a week now . if by tomorrow evening there has nt been a reply , gon na email again to see what has happened .
worry stops us from trusting god . in reality there is no point worrying about those things that are out of our hands there is nothing we can do can change them and we need to trust god with them . although worrying has physical effects , jesus is dwelling on the spiritual side of the issue . as christians we should be living a life of trusting god , not like those people who are not in relationship with god who carry around the weight of the world on their shoulders .
but , says lewis , there is another step . a good comic can tell a racial joke to people of that racial group and make them laugh and he can tell the same joke to people who are not of that ethnic group and make them laugh . if you ca nt tell the joke and get laughs when there are no people of that racial group there , then you should nt tell the joke . you should not tell the joke because it will make the audience feel uncomfortable .
for a lot of writers , this is a major source of anxiety . for as long as you can remember , your book has been your own . the only people who ve read it have been people on your side writer colleagues in your critique group , your friends , your spouse , your kids , your agent , your editor . people who want to like your book because they like you , or because they believe strongly in the book and its potential contribution to children s literature .
usually i eat healthy things now , whole foods and fresh veggies and such . these is not much processed food around the house anymore really . and i do know typically the number of calories i consume in a day . normally if i just wanted to stay as is without doing much work i would be eating about calories a day . but because of all the things i do , and the muscle mass i have just to maintain what i have i have to eat about or so .
i opened my eyes with the pain still there but this time i saw more doctors and nurses around . they asked me to push . i tried . i heard myself scream , and i had a feeling that it was not the first nor the last scream i screamed to them to do something about the pain at the same time that i realized that my request and my pain meant nothing to them . i got nobody s attention this repeated many times that i thought it would never end
yep , that should do it . given my less than stellar record of following through with new year 's resolutions , i 'll never do any of these things . and that 's a good thing . you know , because of the whole reverse psychology thing . and , if by chance i keep my resolutions for the first time in my life , at least i can say that i kept my resolutions it 's a winning situation either way see i 'm way too smart for one person .
i am currently up to where he starts on pool of radiance which is a game i have fallen into quite a number of times . speaking of falling into a game i will probably end up playing a few of them like say pool of radiance so i will either disappear for a bit or start posting about said games . he seems to have needed to take october off because of his job which seeing as the month is almost over i guess i found it at a good time .
i am so thankful for the support and love my dear husband gave me through all this . he had a hard time as well , but was always put me first . i know he s going to be the best daddy any child could ever ask for . so once we get our medical bills paid down a bit were going to start trying again . this baby was unexpected , but now its almost needed . but until it comes , we got one more angel looking out for us
two barren months had passed when it came . i m sorry . it seemed i had waited a lifetime . i tried to not write . if i do nt hear back from you , i ll understand . although , please understand i will have no choice but to write again . he was a young man of his word . three weeks later the next email arrived . less patient , it was only one week after that i read the third . please , is all it said .
there are about pictures i have to go through before i can even begin to post them , so i 'll try to get to that later . we had a blast , it was a cowgirl theme , and the girl loved her cake was there any doubt . there were all kinds of surprises and it was a terrific day . i also realized how much better things are if i let people help me instead of trying to micro manage every part of a party . bring on the help
happy new year guys , it 's a new year and a fresh start , new years eve was a lot of fun . dinner with some of my best friends , and hell of a party later . with some new friends , some old friends i have n't seen in ages and my boyfriend . it was so much fun . and the fire works was beautiful . so tomorrow it 's back to school and work , so it 's time to get to bed . happy new year .
she dropped out of university only after a year and ended up getting a dead end job . but it did nt matter because she met a guy with an awesome job . the two became an item and eventually moved in together . she never felt like the love was there but it was convenient . he was a nice guy and he treated her well . i suppose that s all that should matter in this day and age . there does nt seem to be enough time for love .
i had originally wanted to make another top ten post , but these are these six blogs are the ones i find myself going to most often , and actually taking the time to read their older posts that i have missed etc . these blogs have been super encouraging to me this year , and i 'm sure they will be again next year . if you have the time , jump on over and check some or all of them out . i think you will be glad you did .
he stared at me in shock and then started laughing so hard he had to stop walking . we stood in the middle of the hallway and i watched both directions as i waited for him to get control of himself . if someone came along and saw him like this , it would nt go well for me . when he caught his breath he said , you never thought of giving me anything . he repeated it as if it was the punch line to a good joke . not even
then pass your hand from left to right over the food and bless it . you may notice that the food feels warm to your hand even if the food is cold i like to think that the food is good for me when it feels warm and nourishing to my hand . i have also noticed that when i practice blessing the food , i do nt eat as much . it is important not to let yourself off the hook when you forget to bless the food before you eat .
well , my hubby and i put the beans in her pack in play and did a workout routine together in the field by our house . it was a good workout and i am still a little sore from it . i failed to wake up early this morning like i wanted to start doing because i did nt get to bed until pretty late . i need to rectify that big time . if i am going to be working out regularly , i need to have a better sleep routine .
what the hell is wrong with this picture friends of my parents tell me all the time that it s just stupid what my parents put me though . they say i m the only one going places , the only one making a name for myself , the only one doing something with my life . they say my parents should be proud of me , but they are nt . i wish just once they would tell me how good i m doing for myself . i ll never hear that .
my husband really liked this dish . it is simple and good . he loves stir fry so i am always trying new recipes out on him . let me just tell you that when we were dating i made a simple stir fry with sesame oil . i had never used sesame oil . i thought it was like olive oil . i was sooo wrong . we had to throw it out and go out to eat i have improved since then and am not as generous with the sesame oil .
mix all the ingredients under meat in a pot and place the pot on a medium heat . heat the meat as you mix and break the ground meat with cooking chop sticks or a fork if you do nt have any chop sticks . if you use a fork , be careful as you might leave marks on the bottom of the pot . when the meat is completely cooked , lower the heat and leave it for about minutes . the meat will look like the one on the right photo .
nope . nothing in the computer . after being asked several times if i am sure that i do n't have a gift receipt and if the person who bought it has the receipt , i am told that i can ask the person for their credit card and they could look it up that way but if they paid cash , i 'm out of luck . like i would never think to ask for a receipt . i 'm burning with anger as i walk back to my car with this toy
i am soo excited we have been having some big changes around our home . on friday my daddy , brother and myself went to go serve at a local children 's center . my dad 's work does something like this once a year for all of there employees so this was the first year we got to go . we had so much fun working with the little kids and helping them work in the garden planting the plants . it was great we worked hard and together got everything done .
just because i said , i m a fish does that make me a fish i asked . they all shook their heads no . so , i continued , the same applies to you cleaning your rooms . just because you say i will or okay does nt mean you ll do it . at this point they looked intrigued . so do nt tell me anymore that you will or agree with me the fact you need to do it . simply clean your room , show me you re serious .
it is also an odd sensation to be happy that someone is dead . and do nt take that the wrong way , if she could live forever , the way i knew her when i was a child , i would make it so , because there is nt a person in the world who does nt deserve a chance to know her at her greatest but the truth is , she was suffering , for so long , and with death , i do believe she is a alleviated of that pain .
and it does nt much matter that whether you provide a product or service either . we all know how much apple pays attention to the user or customer experience . every detail of the path their customer takes has been designed and engineered to provide a great and positive experience for the apple customer . and yes , apple spends plenty on traditional advertising and marketing . but i m willing to bet that the experience of buying from apple and then working with their products sells more product than the advertising does .
to continue my month on love and dating . as luck would have it one of my very good friends got married yesterday . as most of you know about me , i am always all up in the mix when it comes to all things chinese . so , i happily agreed when my friend asked me to not only come to the wedding but to be in the wedding . i was very excited to be a part of a traditional chinese wedding . since , my wedding was very non traditional .
i did like the author s direct and conversational style , but i believe i would have enjoyed this book more had there been more of a reference to dogs . for me , the title dog sense led me to believe the dogs in the book would play a larger role . i felt their appearance in the book was rather weak . i would have enjoyed reading less about the bullying of guy by brad , and would have enjoyed reading more about the impact their respective dogs had on their life .
hi , good morning . my girlfriend kate spotted you while visiting me last night and commented the guy in the red car is really cute i know this is crazy and random , i told kate i am leaving you this note . she laughed , half believing me . so if you are single and the age of and interested in a dark haired , blue eyed , small framed girl who s an amazing girl and would like a date coffee , text her as red car boy you never know .
a few weeks after the wedding , i graduated and found myself in between . i do nt do in between well . job hunting and city hunting , i felt i had no clarity on next steps . eventually it all took a toll on me and left me feeling kind of blah . finally , i made some decisions , and in true form , the universe responded in kind . within a few days i had a job offer , a clear path , and a new city to try out .
whatever dutch spotted here could be linked to the objects in the skies over mexico , then again maybe not . sure would be nice if we had an honest government that properly informed it s citizens about the universe , solar system and world we lived in because it certainly appears they know a helluva a lot more than they re letting on . gets tricky trying to figure this stuff out on our own sometimes , because life sure is turning out to be stranger than fiction science fiction to be precise .
one of our group homes had their party a few days ago , and it was a big hit the kids had so much fun with their gifts and their new friends . pizza was had by all . even the foster parents look relaxed we are so grateful to our sponsors for doing this it 's a wonderful thing for the kids , but most important is that the foster parents feel supported in their job . it 's hard work caring for disabled children as if they were your own they deserve it
i think there are a few things that we have to be ready to do when there is that moment of stupidity with our kids . first , remember they are young and will do stupid stuff . my line to my wife is he 's only years old . we have to keep that in mind because sometimes our kids seem like they are very mature and then they act like a kid again and we do n't understand what happened . we have to be ready for them to act like kids .
you know , i also think , i should be straight up . a lot of you will end up somewhere in the pages of a book at some point . i am constantly looking for bits of characters , inspiration for new characters , descriptions of physical appearance and most of all interesting people to base my characters upon . i also like cool names . yes you will end up in a book . and if you 're mean to me your character wo n't survive it . told you i have issues
one fact i learned was that many formal dress stores only carry a limited selection of a brand 's dresses , so finding a design online does not mean the store will have it available to try on . if you really like many of the dresses of one designer it pays to look for one of their trunk shows events , held at different shops at different times of the year , as that is the only way to have an opportunity to try on all the current seasons dresses of that designer .
life is scary and hard . i get tired of defending my beliefs . i get tired of watching bad things happen , and seeing horrible people get away with horrible things . but tonight i thought of how noah must have felt , after pleading with people for so long . it makes me think i can stand a little bit longer with the hard stuff . and it gives me faith that god is in control , and that good will always win , even when it does n't seem that way .
other people will give a range of responses when asked by a friend or close colleague how they felt about their own talk , depending on their perception of how the audience was responding . you can give very similar talks to two different audiences , and in one you feel like you totally rock , and in the other you feel like your talk fell flat . and sometimes you do n't really know and just have a general sense that the talk went pretty well , but you do n't really know .
my two nephews on my husband s side had just turned two years old and boy were they excited for christmas . getting to see the joy and anticipation on their faces that i used to feel caused me to feel some of it myself . we all had so much fun setting everything up on christmas eve see the picture above so that it would be ready for them when they woke up in the morning . when morning finally came the expressions on their faces were more than we could have ever imagined .
we knew that medical records in china were not always correct , but we are thankful she is here in america receiving the proper care . we know she is in god 's hand , and he has a plan for this little girl . our older girls are being great during this as well as being excited about hanging out with their friends instead of having to be at the hospital . we are so thankful for our friends who are helping us with our girls and allowing them to hang with their family .
i started kindergarten when i was , and got kicked out within weeks . i thought they had made a mistake and put me in the special ed class , so to be helpful , i went around doing all the other kids ' classwork for them . the school board recommended to my parents that i be promoted to rd grade , and go to a special school for gifted kids at a local university . instead , my parents put me in to a private religious school . not that i am bitter .
have nt done much chatting since my friend has not been around much this week . been busy with other things . i rarely venture into any random chat rooms these days . i m kind of happy just to visit one or two rooms on a regular basis . after all the years i ve put into it i have started to feel like i d want to do something else with my time . sure it s fun making new friends but there are also other aspects which are not as much fun .
in my case we met in college . we were both in art school together and used to spend countless hours together working on our design projects critiquing each other s artwork . we would listen to music late in to the morning as we missed another night of sleep worried about presenting the best work possible the next day in class . during those times we talked a lot and got to know quite a bit about each other . we both asked questions and learned more and more about what made us us .
well , the confirmation showed i would get my order on the th . i just figured that the ups thing was a mistake or maybe they had figured out my physical address . i was wrong . i waited all day yesterday and nothing ever showed up . at about pm last night , we received a phone call from ups . they wanted to know our house address so , my mom gave it to them she was the one who answered the phone and i figured everything would be ok after all .
these shots are showing the stitch marker in the middle of the row as you can see , i have about or was it stitches on one side of the marker and only or so on the other side of the marker . i 'm not sure how that happened i thought i was counting carefully but i guess not . the sides should be equal . see me trying to use my left hand more the right one is hurting so much that it 's quite hard to make myself use it at times .
three days into our tour and the warm sun of south america is already shining in my heart . since pete and i have no desire to plan anything i 'm excited to see where life takes us . in a day or two we 'll head north towards santa marta , but as it 's a twenty four hour bus ride we 've decided to break it up into a few days and stop where we feel like it . until then , safe travels wherever you are . i 'll keep you posted .
i have decided i will not wait for my husband to change and hope to have good moments or good days . instead i am changing me . i will help my husband become a better man , because he asked for help . he has stayed with me while i became a better woman . but i will help him with a guarded heart . i will help him as a friend . i do nt trust him as a husband . as a husband , the pain he causes is just too great .
we had n't talked much about space before so i introduced positive and negative space . i like to stand like a statue with my hand on my head so i can point out that the statue my body is positive space and the space around me , as well as the hole between my arm and my body are negative space . i showed a piece of paper with the shape of the state of kansas printed on it and the students identified the shape as positive space and the empty border as negative .
in a world in which success seems to be the only thing worth talking about it is hard to see the point in being disappointed , in failing at something . but studies have shown that there is no correlation between success and happiness . people who strive all their lives to reach certain goals or work hard to earn a lot of money and climb the corporate ladder , often say in their twilight years that they regret no living in the moment as they were always looking towards their goals and the future .
as i think about having to go to church , i find myself asking a much bigger question , why would anyone want to miss church it is then that i realize how many truly bad church experiences there are out there . i feel badly for some of the churches i dragged my kids into . as i reflect on what those were , i think to myself , i wished i would have missed many of those sundays why because they were nt an accurate representation of what church is supposed to be .
this is a line from one of the songs on the album . before you leave you write your name on a dirty paper cup . the song is about a boy and a girl on a hot summer afternoon in a park . the paper cup was the only thing he had on which to write his phone number . so it 's a little love story . the reason why i picked this was so as not to give the listener too much clue as to what he should be expecting from the album .
i am a true believer in the fact that it takes a village . my friends have been supportive in a variety of ways . some call to check in while others think ahead to when we could run together . some try other , more sarcastic tactics some of my long time friends have done this with me every year since they 've known me and they are as supportive as ever . katie joined yoga with me which will get me there every wednesday . others have offered to meet me at the gym .
so many people say do n't shoot into the light , but put people in front of the light and let it come through their hair . think about moving yourself through the scene to figure out where it 's reflecting best and where you can see the colors and the details and more . one of the most important things you can learn in photography is learning how you can use the light . use to your advantage whatever light you have . windows are awesome for this because they frequently are n't harsh light .
my other homework assignment was to look at my relationship . to see how we complete each other , how we play off of one another . how we push each other to grow , etc . i have a basis for this i know there are a lot of ways in which my so has caused me to grow and change for the better , but i m not sure if i m supposed to be looking at it from another angle , or something else . i imagine it ll become clearer in time .
think now about your siblings . did you have any were you an only child did any of your attitudes towards them or their attitudes towards you cause you anxiety or shame how did your parents treat all of you , did they play you against one another was there unhealthy competition between you because of your parents playing favorites just remember , like we learned in the previous exercise , none of this is about you . you had almost nothing to do with your parents system of managing you and your siblings as children .
the friend i saw yesterday was not kind and i now feel strong enough to say not a friend . it started badly can i have a shower i do nt want to use my hot water and ended worse if ever anyone starts a sentence christmas was nt great as i was watching my dad die the response should not begin well it s alright for you . also if a friend says last year was a living nightmare the expected response is not you did nt make time for me i hardly saw you .
when i was a social worker , i worked in an emotional support school . for a while there , they played dodgeball during their gym hour . what inevitably happens when one plays dodgeball with emotionally challenged kids is that someone gets hurt , someone gets angry , and someone gets in trouble . in the end , the kids were nt allowed to play dodgeball anymore because of the negative experience a few kids had . in short , it was far easier to avoid conflict than to teach them how to resolve it .
sticking together does nt necessarily mean we all have to agree on everything . there are a lot of folks in the autism community saying things that i do nt believe in or agree with . but , dammit , if their kids have autism or if they themselves have autism or sometimes both then ca nt we support them in their right to say what they want and to support who they want we do nt have to tear each other down or tell them we think they re wrong and that we re right .
these books show one thing that god is truly in control of our lives . without him , we can not succeed . without him , we can not have the courage face trials . with him , we can do all things jesus second coming will happen . as to when , only father god knows . as believers of christ , let s make a difference in our lives . we are also called to make disciples of all nations . with god , we can make this happen . make a difference now .
the other thing about these little things is that there are nt enough positive things to outweigh them . i know every relationship is going to have situations that have a negative pull on it , but i think the good things have to outweigh the bad things to make the relationship worthwhile i have tense moments with my daughters at times , but overall we enjoy each others company a lot more than we have differences . so it makes for a good relationship i have with each of them and they with each other .
and so we circle back to being grateful for everything . i am truly grateful for everything , the good , the horrible , and that middle ground we tend to ignore . like most , i learn best from my mistakes and poor choices . today , i am grateful for all of those mistakes , unfortunate life experiences , and bad choices , for if i had not had them , i would not be who i am today . embrace your mistakes and bad choices and see just how far they ve brought you
i would start off this post by wishing everyone a happy new year i 'm so grateful for that i 'm still doing work that i enjoy and doing my hobby baking that is at the same time . although i must say that compared to , i baked a lot more in and i 'm glad that at least i think i 'm growing in terms of knowledge . i also get to see and spend time with my mom , twin sis , and my other brother that i have n't met for years .
this job is ideal in that it is around hours a week and is pretty flexible and i can do most of it from home aside from the actual therapy . i have a small case load of one and it is perfect . wonderful college girls take care of ava while i am gone so i know she is in good hands . you all make it possible . thank you . knowing your child is safe and with people that love her provides justin and i with such a sense of peace and gratitude .
she always told me that we were n't allowed to grow up but now that i have you , i know what she meant . there are days that i just want to freeze time so that i can protect you forever . like this morning , when you fell asleep on my chest , i wanted to stay in that moment forever , just listening to you snore and breathing you in . but just as fast as i wish you would stay months old forever , i ca n't wait to see you grow up .
i was blessed by a colleague who called me the other day . she was calling to talk about something related to work and before we launched into all of that , i wanted to ask her how she was doing . she said that she was feeling tired and that the feeling was nt coming from being overworked but from something else . she felt that she was nt showing up fully in the ways that made her feel good about herself and her work product . wow this is exactly how i have been feeling .
k yes , who had no link to hamas . all the rest had a clear tie to hamas . and each of the cases in which those were killed must be checked . those are , of course , too many . that does nt mean that we should nt have carried out the operations of cast lead as we did . but it does mean that if there s a cast lead ii , we ll have to use approaches that mean there wo nt be the that there ll be the fewer the better .
however , my latest reading has made me very happy . you ca nt complain about the book where the title of the first chapter is why it is hard to meet an average french person . after reading several books on interviewing techniques not that they were not interesting because three out of the four were , a book that appears to teach one how to be french as a means of explaining the culture is amazing and by amazing , i mean amusing and i also have no idea why i m reading this book .
no . no sorry . let me help you . you are confused and you have no idea what you feel . however , i am the knower of everything and i know love is nt one of your feelings right now . you do nt know me near enough to be thinking that . you might love the idea of me , but not actually me . i sold you the me from the plan , not the me in reality . the view from reality is nt as glorious as what the plan tells you .
for instance , i had a dream that someone i know a male was mad at me and punched the hood of my car i woke up scared and through research , i found out it was about a frustration i was having with a specific task at work . there were a few specific items in the dream that were significant . the car was red passion , the car was on my right side present day vs the past , the car was parked stuck feeling , denting the car my frustration at feeling stuck .
i think it comes down to fear . a lot of pregnancy fear comes from the feeling that a person is going to be out of control . during pregnancy your body is not your own it is the domain of another and they are nt going to treat it that nicely . the idea that things will be the same afterwards sort of works to soothe those feelings of fear and makes it all alright . however , all this does it put a lot of pressure on women who may already be at breaking point .
for the next hour we waited , knowing she ended her shift at . we had no idea if she would come out and meet the teens waiting for her , but she did . what a lovely person . she gave each of the girls a big hug , shook hands with the boys , and thanked all of them for supporting her . my kids were thrilled . meeting the person behind the voice whether a radio host like electra or an author of a book is something both of my kids love to do .
a guy got off of the plane and when we were outside he told me that he had cried on the plane . he , too , had an entire row on the plane to himself . he thought it was going to be the end . it was the first time ever that i thought to myself that i wished someone was sitting next to me on the plane so that i would have had someone s hand to hold . i wished him luck in life just in case we never cross paths ever again .
i ca nt even begin to tell you how tender it was . it almost fell apart just looking at it . the sauce and brown sugar were the perfect mixture and complemented each other very well . i definitely chose an easy recipe going into this , but there was nt a darn thing wrong with it . it had the flavor we love and it was so incredibly tender . i might try and make my own sauce from scratch next time . maybe . this might be hard to top for easy and delicious .
once upon a time , my mom knit a stress blanket . she called it her stress blanket because it did n't involve a pattern , used up lots of scraps of yarn she had laying around , and was knit at a time when my family i was a teenager at the time was in the process of moving from wisconsin to texas . i 'm sure it kept her plenty warm on a cold wisconsin evening , which probably also helped combat the stress , and it was about the ugliest thing you 've ever seen .
so ya see , even though i would say i have a long way to go and have so much to learn , i stepped out of my comfort zone , tried something new and ya know what , i actually had a blast . i learned a thing or two and helped a friend save some cash . and she s gon na need it too . she will be making a trip this summer to california to watch this young man graduate boot camp as a united states marine . she could nt be more proud .
i like to feature outfits where most of you already have the pieces in your closet to put together something like this . there are a lot of classic pieces here like a black skirt , a black leather jacket and a neutral top . i bet most of you also have a long necklace . if you d like to add this look to your wardrobe but need to buy some pieces to make it work , here are my suggestions just for you just click on the picture for more details give your wednesday a little attitude
jason and i went out for dinner last saturday evening and used an olive garden gift card given to us for our anniversary . it was really nice . it can be tough for couples to reconnect after having a baby as it is . the grief of losing a child can strain a relationship to the breaking point for some . i am happy that jason and i have been able to hold each other up through everything . i was blessed with a terrific husband and am glad that g d led us to each other .
so its that time of year , where things end and new things begin . i was trying to think of how to do this , since last year i made a series of posts about my favorite pictures of the year and the stories behind them . while i do have some favorite photos from this year , but i wanted this to be a bit more about other things i enjoyed this year as well . so here are my favorite things from this year , in no real order , as they come to me .
i learned an important lesson this spring about jumping the gun . i had to re seed everything because obviously the ground was too cold when i first put the garden in . we also got hit by a no fair frost a couple weeks ago . miss chef and i had covered everything carefully , but we had to replace several tomatoes , and i m not sure if the peppers will recover sufficiently to produce . still , i will leave them to their own devices , cause i m sure they know what to do .
fantasy is huge right now , particularly for young adult readers . i do nt have the numbers , but i am sure that every week dozens of new fantasy novels are released . probably to percent of the novels are written by white authors about white characters . these books may have black and other minority secondary characters , or they may have none at all . side note those books always seemed kind of strange to me . i always wondered where these authors lived that the world that they saw only came in one shade .
my youngest is in kindergarten six years old going on he thinks , and always has , i assume because of his older siblings . needless to say , with his siblings all quite a bit older than him , he knows the latest dance moves of high school and college students as well as the words to the most current , hip music but as such , he has never been that into toys mostly he just tears all of them out of his closet into a mess on the floor and then leaves to go play outside
most of the women to whom i have taught this technique report that the turning occurred not while they were actually going through the movements but later , when they were relaxed , for example as in the story just quoted when taking a bath . do not expect your baby to turn after the first time you try the movements . repeat it several times each day . do nt give up . the majority of breech babies will turn eventually . however , we must accept that a few will not , probably because they can not
you could have said , we are very sensitive to the pain of so many americans during the ongoing recession . we are bringing billion in business back to the us in the hope that this will put some of our deserving fellow citizens back to work . even if the reality is that much of the billion will be spent elsewhere and the contract would only create one more job , every job is valuable these days . and it would look so much better to the kind , generous people whose money you are currently living on .
i m so incredibly angry , in a way that is nt mature , healthy or attractive . angry at him , angry at her , angry at the situation , angry at myself for even being angry . jesus , i was supposed to be over this . now was the time for acceptance damn it i was the bigger person why am i letting him continue to have this power over me why am i now , a year after everything happened , finally feeling the anger and resentment for everything he did to me not just this
hope for the silent voices also allows her the freedom to be who god created her to be without shame to use her journey through life to bring a voice to those who have been silent for too long and from whom hope has been taken . she has had the privilege of seeing other parts of the world and people who have shown her what joy , peace and living is really all about . she continues to search the world for those in pain and to provide hope for those who suffer at the hands of evil .
had paul gone into such detail he would have lost the jews for they only knew of the law in which they took pride . that may be the reason many today do not see the difference for they know jesus christ physically and not spiritually . i also gain this insight by reading our newspapers . religious leaders are treating christianity as a science . thus the church is compared to all the clubs and organizations of the world . remember that the church , the body of christ is not an organization , but a spiritual organism .
even non christians know this scripture quote about our body being temple , yet we ignore it as easily as we ignore god 's other instructions and laws . it starts from the top of the food chain and ends in our hearts . the problem that we are having others and my family is that the government and corporations have made it virtually impossible to go back to basics in this world . i am not only referring to our food sources , but also the generations of change in products , utilities and leadership in this nation .
what i m not fine with is my dumb ass continues to not take my fucking medicine and then i get a little crazy . or at least i get a little crazier than normal . what i really hate is when i actually get depressed . most of my episodes are nt so much depression as anger which i kindly take out on the people i work with i m sure they love that . i m sure they love that even more since they are technically working for me as in i m the boss , bitch .
i pulled her into my lap and rocked her and told her that all teachers have different styles and that her new teacher might just take some getting used to . my logical brain believes this , but my gut tells me it 's bullshit . i advised her to give it a day or two to be open to her new teacher and all of the change that a new school year brings and that if she still feels this way at the end of the week , i 'll schedule some time to speak with her teacher .
you know what really did it for me yesterday what made my mood turn around hold on to your hats , this may be totally shocking , so you might want to sit down . what made me feel better yesterday was wait for it exercise . crazy concept , i know . who knew that focusing your energy , working up a sweat , and burning a crazy amount calories could make a girl feel so much better oh wait , i did know that , i just forgot for minute or two ok a day or two .
i 'm the mom who carries all those things for my kids , because i know how easy it is for me at yo forget where i 've put my stuff . because i will never say to my child sorry , you lost it , now it 's gone and i wo n't replace it . because it 's no big deal for me to take from my child what he asks me to hold , and put it in my bag so it wo n't get wet , or stolen , or stepped on , or broken .
so while i lay there , listening to a woman i ve never met before , i prayed for her . i prayed for her husband , her family , and i thanked god for mine . today i felt fried to a crisp in more ways than one . lots was going on that i wished was different in life but in this moment , god chose to use me to be an ear for someone and it felt good to be used . no matter the circumstances , that is enough to make a bad day good .
my son was an easy baby . he 's a pretty easy kid still at years old . emma , on the other hand , is already her own person at the age of four . she was her own person before she was born . i was sick the whole pregnancy . she had to be forced out . the only good hospital photo taken was one where she was giving the finger ... my one regret in life is not having that one printed . i should have known it was a sign of what was to come .
i adapted this recipe from a few different recipes . it 's not an exact recipe i use what i have on hand , and i do n't measure when i cook . feel free to add more or less depending on what you have or your family 's taste . since the prep work is done the night before , it takes almost no time to prepare this the day you cook it . i like to make this whole chicken in the crock pot , but you could make bake it in the oven for a crispy outside .
my brother and i decided a while ago that when it came to coming up with a title , we would both brainstorm and write down ideas any and all that we could think up over , say , a week . then we d send them to each other and decide which were our favorite . then we d talk until we both decided on one that we felt fit the book though i have final say , my brother is as creative in many ways as i am , and his ideas usually have good reason behind them .
i hunt because it is a lifestyle and it 's my lifestyle . it 's dreaming of being out on a hunt when stuck in the office . it 's knowing that right now it 's midnight , i just got my kid to sleep but it 's ok because in hours my alarm is going off and i am going hunting . it 's knowing that when you 're out there in the woods , in your blind , or in your tree stand all your worries are gone and that is a feeling that no substance can duplicate .
but there 's something else that has changed , and it 's been working in my heart for a few months now . it 's the question of what is my purpose a question i 'm sure most if not all of us have asked ourselves . i 've been praying , talking , and pondering this . and even more so , how does this involve my natural gifts as an artist i ask myself this question almost every six months , and it 's a cycle , but i feel it 's necessary if i am to grow .
no , this game has very little charm compared to the others . i am sure , if it had been just a computer game , it would have worked . but considering the games it is following , trying to live up to , it falls flat at least that is my first feel for it , after having played all the fractions once . i will give it another try to see if i missed something , but i am not jumping for joy at the thought and honestly , was that not the point of playing a game
being responsible for your birth means shifting from a cultural place of control , to a place of trust and inner knowing that all is well and as it should be . it is a space of acceptance for what is and then from that position of well being , informed decisions can be made . making decisions from a place of fear or worry is nt ideal , but unfortunately , in our culture , fear is what fuels most decisions . it is no wonder that birth becomes something very scary for most women . page of sexy birth
what i can do , is focus my own happy thoughts towards my family and create the life that i want and help my family members do the same . in so doing all of us help others through our thoughts and actions . i always wanted a home that was open to others , a place that people feel safe to be in and enjoy spending time in . i never thought it would be that to dozens of teenagers . i never knew how many teenagers there are growing up without happy homes full of love and peace .
i have three daughters . i have identical twin girls , and then a third one that came months later . i will not lie to you . the first years sucked . okay , they did n't suck . they were adorable girls , honest they were . but those years were hard . three little ones under the age of was not a picnic . the twins were delayed , and that made it three times as hard . they could n't talk . the terrible 's were the terrible oh my gods . momma did not sleep much .
i am amazed at how i can experience , every once in a while , a kind of life changing moment through a realization which god seems to be giving me , into nothing less than a breakthrough of sorts . just as amazing , however , is how a few weeks , perhaps even days later , it seems like i need to learn at least something of that lesson all over again . somehow i had not kept it in memory and practice . or else there is the need for further growth and development in that very area .
but i m sure that if you are a person who is mature enough and well grounded up then you understand that there should be something after this life . i think its an obvious fact that good things come from heaven and bad things come from hell . if someone will tell me that there is hell then i m sure you wo nt mind me asking what is the source of all the bad things that happen in this world same thing with question of heaven , if there is no heaven then where do the good things come from
we are really enjoying our new bible study and fellowship . we had another couple join us this week so we have a total of of us . we first have a meal around the table and then continue on with our bible study . marvin and i are the still the youngest couple by about or years although i know a few are . we got to know each other better by going around the table and talking about where we were born and how we met . i loved to hear all the stories . we laughed and laughed .
friday was the oldest 's th birthday , and in true fashion asked for a happy hour play date as a party . earlier that day , i worked in the classroom and led destination imagination instant challenges after school . so we had of his friends over , a couple of their siblings , and all of their moms . the kids played and ran around and had fun , and the moms sat around , visited and drank . the party started at , and ended past . i had too much to drink and slept like the dead ...
after you have been relieved of your debt , start setting some savings goals . figure out what it is you re saving for , how much money you will need , and about how long it will take you to get to that goal in order to achieve it . when figuring out how much you will need to save , it would be best to save the same amount each period . this time frame of saving must be realistic , or else you will just get discouraged and it will push you further and further from your goal .
good things is the fourth song on the record and was released almost an entire year before war paint , although it is not officially listed as a single . this songs seems to be perdomo wondering why things do nt go his way much of the time . i ll try to turn things around , but instead i ll say why do i feel so invisible good things will come my way . the song finds perdomo hopeful that things will get better for him and that things wo nt always be as they have been in the past .
oh how the horror of what if , and did i , plays over and over in my mind . that night i lay awake staring at the ceiling telling myself , self , the story is sent so there is no use worrying , you ca nt take it back now . then magically in a few days you block out the thought that you even sent out a submission , because the reality of it is you will probably be waiting for quite a few weeks before your manuscript will even have a pair of eyes look at it .
i could nt help but stare at the man sat on the table next to us . he was alone and had ordered a big plate of chips with an even bigger burger . at first i thought , look at you eating out , on your own , such a confident soul . an hour later , he was still there , with nearly the same amount of food on his plate . two hours later , he began carefully cutting his chips into thirds . i came to the conclusion that he definitely had some form of eating disorder .
time after time elijah saw the great miracles god did yet he still felt like just giving up . i will admit i have those moments too times when i would just like to hide under the covers and not face the world . we may not see the same kind of miracles elijah did but everyday god gives us our own miracles , both big and small . like elijah we become so wrapped up in our own fears and concerns that we forget what god is doing in us and through us and what he has promised to do .
for father 's day , i surprised jackson by singing a song for him at church with a slide show of pictures of him and the girls playing . he is such an amazing father that i wanted to honor him with this tribute jackson is an incredibly hard worker . he gets up at am every day , works all day , comes home then most evening works out on our new house . even though his to do list is incredibly long and he is incredibly tired , he still makes sure that he spends time with the girls .
the other night i had a dream about a house . i was standing directly in front of the house looking at it . in my dream it was not the home i live in now , but a home i had just bought and i was really excited about it . i took a camera out of my pocket and took a picture of it and told myself in my dream that i wanted a picture of it so i would n't forget what it looked like . i snapped the pic and that was the end of the dream .
i know i have said it before , but i will say it again . thank you to all who prayed and supported me in your own ways i will never be able to express the amount of gratitude i have for all of you . those who i know and those who i do n't . you made a difference . every prayer said for our team made a difference . every tiny encouragement made a difference . thank you , thank you , thank you . i love you all . thank you for being apart of my journey .
i went out for a drink with my dad tonight . now , dad and i do n't always see eye to eye . he lets me run the bar as i see fit , and he 's happy with the result . in the kitchen , occasionally he 'll over rule me a suggest i do a special in a different way , or with a different sauce . but on the whole recently we seem to be agreeing a lot more , which is making life a bit easier for both of us and work a bit more fun .
if i get it done , i do . if not , that s ok too . i ll just keep working at it and do what i can . the rest will happen in its time things always do . time is a funny thing . we all have that same amount of it in a day some us just make better use of it than others . i lived in new orleans for a long time and one of the many things my co workers and i said to each other those days we had to work hour days was
as i have mentioned before , i have struggled with just about every aspect of sexual sin since , truthfully , before i can remember . still as an adult , a married woman , the battle is fought daily . old habits die hard and desire can be like an all consuming fire when it is not within god s design . and to make matters worse , i constantly hear the words of the enemy when he says that i ca nt possibly be saved because if i was , i for sure would nt be dealing with this anymore .
i remember driving home that afternoon with my head in a fog , and when i got home i just hugged jenny and held her for the longest time and promised her that everything would be okay . she needed to hear me say that . i needed to hear me say that too . i 'm not sure whether or not either of us believed it , but we both needed to hear me say it . it was the day before laura 's second birthday , and we were both wondering what kind of world lay in store for her .
i would go for a . population town . this is usually big enough for the things you want a city for yet not so big that it would fall apart . small enough that people eventually get to know each other and there s a sense of small town community yet at the same time tis not that small that no one would give a damn about it . this size of town usually means that there s acceptable services , hospitals , maybe a community college or university your kids can go to rather than moving hundreds of miles away .
when i teach a lesson to my adult esl students , i find that every group is different . what worked for one group might not work for another . i find this out by observation and by asking questions . since my kids have had the opportunity to learn at home all their lives , they have had the chance to listen to who they are . they have had the chance to figure out what type of learning works best for who they are as individuals . honestly , they have done quite well without research getting in the way .
last sunday at mass i was confronted with the above question . as it happened it was a day when i was in quite a bit of physical pain . the pain did nt start out to be really bad . i would be all right walking to church , so i thought . but far from it . after walking the distance , which took about twenty five minutes , the pain was getting quite considerable . i arrived at the church at the last minute . but father was still standing there shaking hands . he shook my hand too .
the crazy thing is that i never shared my passions , not even with my best friends . i think they may have guessed how obsessed i was with star wars and old movies . they had no understanding of my desire to be on stage . and i never once told them the name of the boy i had a crush on . at the time , i think i thought it was self protection . that if my dreams did n't come true , at least no one knew about them , so i did n't have to be ashamed .
we have one car . my parents get home at to ish . i did have one job at a fast food restaurant , minutes away halfway to the city . it was hard , but i managed to get there because at the time my dad could nt find a job , and he drove me to work while he picked up my mother and now he has a job , so mine is no more . plus , i really hated it there . people do nt give enough respect to the people making their food for them . jeesh .
somewhere in the back of my closet i found a surprise today . about years ago i made this dress for a party , then soon after discovered i was pregnant , those two events were not related . it meant that this dress was relegated to the i 'll wear it again in the future area of the closet , and had n't been discovered again since . i found both the dress and a pair of suitable shoes , and was actually able to put an outfit together that felt a little more like my style even with the shoes .
my best friend sue and i both share a love for hello kitty , so i wanted to make her some sort of hello kitty cake for her birthday this year . last year i made her this cake inspired by boston cream pie , and while i thought it looked pretty , it did n't live up to my expectations in the taste department . so this year i wanted to make her something that tasted great , and since i know she loved my triple chocolate mousse cake , i decided to make her a hello kitty triple chocolate mousse cake
we become so used to what is presented as beauty in our culture that it is easy to become confused about god 's design for beauty in women . i once read a christian author who believed that a reasonable amount of time to spend on her appearance was a tithe amount of her day . that would be at least an hour and a half each day . it seems to me that god has an awful lot of work for us to do in the world that could be done with an extra ten and a half hours per week .
first , remember the apostles on that lonely saturday . what did they do they prayed . waiting is a great opportunity to pause and spend time in the presence of god in prayer . he wants to hear from you , and the only way you ll have a great relationship with him is to talk to him . pray for all kinds of things that you are going through , but do nt forget to pray for those who are making you have to wait . perhaps they are having something worse than waiting that is going on with them .
see that plastic craft box in the middle it 's one of these boxes you can get at michael 's to keep beads organized . each cubby is labeled with a letter and the beans are put back in the correct section when the kids finish making their word . if you 're looking for a fun new way to practice sight words at home , this is a quick and easy way to practice . you can write the word for your child . they build the word with their bean letters . then they write the word when they are finished .
this year , i used vacation days in addition to my day off and independence day holiday to get tuesday july rd afternoon through sunday july th off . and wanting to go somewhere , but having limited funds , we are off to montana for at least a part of that depending on how much time off cool can get . montana , because it s cheaper then seattle and slightly closer . though we could have chosen the german , i suppose . but that s good for short trips since we would have to pay to stay the night there .
some tutorials i do simply to share techniques that work for me . others , i write in order to force myself to expand my own knowledge . the latter is the case with an alpha mask tutorial that i hope to write . i 'm more of a layer mask guy , so this whole alpha thing is not something i normally do . i decided to read up on alpha masks and then got distracted as i am wo nt to do . actually , distracted is not quite right . burnt out from technical details is probably more like it .
after we moved here and decided months later to let our cats outside they were inside only for the first two years of their lives clark stayed out one night we could n't find him and the next morning he was out back looking like he felt horrible . he could barely walk , was shaky , did n't want to eat or drink , and all those lovely things . we took him to the vet and the result was like what just happened but it had been longer since he lost the fight so he was worse off his temperature was .
if i may tell a little story from my experience . over years ago , when i was a teenager , i saw a girl that i thought was the most beautiful girl i d ever seen . she looked to me like a movie star . i had no hopes of even talking to her , but her face haunted my dreams . later i met her at school and she smiled at me and of course , my face turned red . what was i feeling i believe it was eros , the love of desire , the love of passion .
i did not think that k 's birthday would go by without me seeing her and giving her a present . she turned this past october . her daughter 's birthday is two days after mine . and now here it is , christmas eve , and my heart just breaks . not because i ca n't be with them , but because it makes me sad to think that i wo n't know how those kids are , what will happen to them . they 're beautiful , good kids , trust me . those of you who met them know this .
sharlie wanted us to know that she is aware of the risks , and while she believes and has tremendous faith that everything will go well , she wanted us to know that she has lived such a full life . she has . she has touched thousands with her kindness and she is the type of person that inspires everyone around her . she makes me want to be a better brother , a better husband , a better father , and a better person . she has lived a full life , but i think her best years are yet to come .
it is in a woman that man s body is formed , and it is of a woman that he is born , it is to a woman that he pledges his word , it is a woman who is his companion , with a woman he shares his roof , and it is through her that his life is lived out . when a wife dies , one looks for another . society can only exist through her since it is through her that kings are born . all creatures are born of the female of the species without her none can exist .
a new month has arrived and it is actually my favorite month of the year . i love pink , hearts and fast things . for some reason , having less days in a month makes it fly by . i am going to be starting a new monthly post on my blog . goals for the month . each month i always make some personal goals , but i never share them with anyone , so this month and the ones to follow , i am going to share them with you . then i can look back and see what i accomplished .
my cough is worse , i m even more sore from sunday s fall , and i have no energy . i ll try to write , but i m not holding my breath . i can hear the wind blowing , the color out there is grey , and i might even call the doctor , but really , i can hardly imagine all the work it will take to shower , dress , and drive the eleven miles to his office , even if i could get an appointment . all i want to do is curl up and sleep all day .
friday afternoon i felt defeated , my best laid plans were cast aside as life happened , you know those parts of our lives like wife , mother , sister , employee yeah , well i ca nt very well cut out the paying job to play in my writing garden , as it was told to me . i was ready to chuck it all , cry myself a river , and sit by the bank and watch it all flow away . what would that get me not what i want , so i chucked that ideal it was a weed after all .
i had my constitutional law final today which was three hours long and counts for my entire grade for the semester no pressure though . i do nt know if there are rules regarding speaking about or transmitting test questions prior to when grades are released so i will air on the side of caution and not go into detail . grades will not be released for another month and my legal skills grade could even be well into june . i will say though that there were five questions three minute questions and two minute questions which made for quite a bit of typing .
i am not telling you what to do . i m simply stating that i would just like a little more proof you are who you say you are . i have the paperwork completed for the western union transfer please see attached and i am standing at the western union location right now . i just want to make sure i m sending it to the right person . you can understand that i need to be very cautious . so please , if you do nt mind , i request that you attach the requested photo and then i will submit the paperwork .
i looked at my watch . damn sometimes i hate being a grown up i had to leave in minutes to go to work . but i really did n't want to pass up this opportunity . i decided to call my boss . i usually start work at but kids do n't arrive until so i could technically let my staff set up and show up just in time to receive kids and no harm would be done . my boss was really kind about it . she allowed me to stay . it was n't much time , but it was better than none
surgery is a short term fix and will not result in long term success without a lot of effort . i will admit that looking great takes a lot of effort in today s society . portion sizes are enormous , we work too much , and it can be hard to fit in exercise . unless you get a spot on the biggest loser or go away to a weight loss camp , you will have to make constant efforts to lose weight . it s worth it because the healthier you feel , the better your life will be . you are worth it
and things are really starting to happen . over the weekend i ran a two day free promotion on amazon and , people downloaded the book . some of them must be reading it and liking it because each morning i see that more and more people are starting to buy it , borrow it , and tell their friends about it . this is what gives me the greatest joy when you work alone all day , year after year , you can get a little hungry for feedback . here are two of the lovely reviews on amazon that came in since the weekend
and because it 's a book launch party , i 'll be telling you all about my new release , women of strength , and inviting you to purchase it by clicking here . it 's not in stores yet at least , that i know of , and i 'm in a cast , so there could be a lot going on out there that i do n't know about and you 'll be among the first to get a copy what 's awesome is that amazon just lowered the price it used to be . , but right now it 's only . .
i hunt because of the memories of years past , knowing years ago my grandfather hunted underneath this exact tree , or at this exact lake , or in this exact field , with this exact goal . it 's like he is still there with me , and even that he will always be there with me while i am hunting . it 's knowing my daughter will be in the same spot in years to come . it 's knowing that i am passing on to my kids what my grandfather taught my dad and what my dad taught and is still teaching me .
chamille is n't holding her breath . she asked me why it seems that we are the only ones who seem to see that what they are doing is n't going to work . this girl 's other friends are all in favor of her playing nice to get her life back . chamille is , and always has been , about honesty , even if it 's painful or uncomfortable . she wonders why her friend does n't just talk to her mom honestly and tell her exactly how she feels and what she wants , at this point , what would she have to lose
before i knew it i was defending our friend saying how we each have different priorities . she has always been an ' on demand ' mother , i trained my daughter in a schedule that meant she slept for the right amount of time , ate the right amount of times and have basically made people adhere to her schedule if they want to see her i wish i could have been as relaxed as our friend whose babies also eat and sleep the right amount but i needed to put her in a routine so i could feel secure i was doing things right .
today , i was able to see what stuck when i was dealing with a student who wanted to go home just after lunch . he had had an issue outside with some other students , during the lunch hour . he did not want to sit down and talk about it so we decided to take my therapy dog , jack , for a walk around the block to clear the student s thinking . he needed to get out of the school , he said . fortunately , jack is always up for a walk . that dog can be a real lifesaver at times
flesh does nt really win . flesh never really wins . flesh lost that day on the cross when the sky turned black and the curtain was torn , yet we continue to live our lives as if we are powerless over our flesh . granted , we , in and of ourselves , are powerless , but that is nt the point . the point is that we do nt have to be powerless . we can win . we can be free from our flesh and even when we are nt , even when flesh does win , the victory still belongs to christ .
on a very different note , i am currently very busy getting ready for a holiday . next week i will be heading off to spend days in hong kong with my mother shopping , eating and sight seeing . i ca nt tell you how excited i am my mother and i have been talking about taking a holiday together ever since i was and it is hard for me to believe that years later it is finally happening . what s more , this will be my first ever trip outside of australia . i m a little nervous , actually but mostly just excited
recently i have been blessed to get to know several wonderful christians who truly inspire me . they are people who have spent a lot of time sitting at the feet of jesus . i admire the many spiritual gifts in their lives and in particular the gifts of wisdom , self control and love the unconditional kind . when they speak of others they practice great self control and in both their thinking , their words and their actions . they speak good of others , no matter what . it s inspiring . they make me long for the fruits i see in their lives .
part of my journey this past year has been to learn to do with less , to learn how to manage the big stresses in life , when it looks like it all will be taken away . at some point this past year i realized that i did n't own my stuff , my stuff owned me . a friend reminded me that i stressed over giving up some of my stuff because i placed too much importance in it . otherwise , it would n't cause me so much pain to lose it . the really important things in life are not made of stuff .
now , these are only a few images that i ve seen . if i were to put all of the ones i ve seen on here it would take an extremely long time . of course , not all fashion photography and advertising is like this , but it does seem to be a growing trend . i do nt know about you , but this does not make me want to buy what they re selling . if anything , it completely turns me off . what do you think is the fashion industry going too far with it s creativity or are you a fan
i just bought these , so i wanted to test them out . i checked out the instructions that came with them , did the little pinch , and i looked back at the chart and holy shit , body fat i did nt realize how fat of a fuck i was . i checked a couple more times , but the number never changed . i then realized that i was reading the chart for women and all was well with the world once more . according to the men s scale , i m at , so there s definitely still work to be done .
i requested to be put on the available anytime waiting list . this was in mid december and i knew with my luck that i would likely get called in on christmas eve at am when i was hours north of the city with my family . i did nt care . i would take any appointment i could get i received a phone call only days later asking me to come in on a monday morning , a week before christmas at am . i practically fell off the chair with excitement and i m pretty sure that after i got off the phone i cried with relief
i m married to a man who will do what it takes to take care of his family . most of our married life he has worked several jobs at a time and never ones that are glorious , and always at bad hours of the day and none of them are ones he went to school for a career for . but as yucky as that is we both know that it s what comes at the end of the day , whatever time that maybe , that really counts . i am lucky . i am blessed . i do nt forget that for a moment .
it s also time for me to put on my big girl socks and get my professional face on . not to say i have nt been professional i ve just spent a lot of time getting to know my delightful cast and taking things as they come . now it s time to remember i need to pull back and get my head completely in the game . things are only going to get more intense from here on out so it s so critical for me to be as focused and ready . and trust me , i am ready . i m hungry for this .
you see , here s the critical thing about sole parents . they are , for whatever reason , sole parents . that means that they have no other back up , they have no one else who can step up and help in an emergency . the other parent is , by definition , not there . and most times , family members are nt available to help either . they are busy working themselves . that means that if the state is going to require sole parents to work , then the state will need to ensure that conditions are such that sole parents can work .
if you are stuck in your writing , or you want to try a different approach , or you are just getting bored with a character or story , try something to change your perspective . it can be a real thing , like moving your couch and sitting in a new place to think . it can be a variation to your writing routine , like moving outside or switching sides of the cafe booth where you always sit . it can even be an exercise , like writing the same scene from the eyes of a different character or changing from third person to first person .
november helped me break through to my th read this year . that is of course not counting the other plenitude of things i read such as short stories and even more graphic novels then i usually mention i try to focus on graphic novels i think most highly of . a big help was my annual thanksgiving break where of these were finished . as we approach the end of the year i 've been thinking about what other books to read for my year end list and i 've definitely got a few thoughts . anyway here are my brief thoughts on books read in november .
but since i made somewhat of a conscious decision to go out a bit less , and spend more time doing whatever with ross at home , i love it . one of the biggest reasons i married this man was because he 's so damn fun to talk to , and trust me , i talk his ear off . i know this sounds almost silly for two people who are married , but now that we have more stuff in common , our conversations have upgraded . conversations are extremely important to me , period , but they should be especially important with your husband , right
the photo op line ran a bit long which makes me incredibly happy for heather her lines all weekend were really long which means a lot of work for her , but at the same time , how awesome is that so i thought i d missed the return of the living dead announcement that was supposed to happen before a short film package that i wanted to see . luckily , they had nt started yet and while i had guessed what the announcement was going to be about thanks to a few clues that were dropped , i was still incredibly excited to see the trailer .
i just do n't understand how anyone can go through the psychological classes , all the testing , and the surgery including the pain afterwards , basically being on a liquid to soft food diet for almost two months and spend almost k depending on your insurance coverage and not at least make an attempt to follow up on everything you 've just gone through . it 's one thing to go on a diet and maybe not follow through with that ... this is something completely different . i understand that the surgery is just a tool to help you , but it 's a major life changing tool
i have always hated my entry way cabinet , it has been around for over years and has served many purposes . it has been beaten up pretty bad over the last few moves , and has been painted many different colors over it 's life . the other down side to this table is there is not much space on the top , which would be nice . i would like to create a space for us to drop our keys or mail when we walk threw the door . it is time to retire the entry table and buy a new one , let the shopping begin .
just prayers . i 'm trying not to panic and let fear and anxiety of the unknown take over . i can feel it , almost rushing up my throat in the most random times . it is really hard not to focus on the future , and i know that i do better if i just focus on the here and now . one day at a time . but there is also so much to prepare for . chris and i are going to try and be as ready as we can by the end of the week nesting , cleaning , making packing lists , etc .
i know a lot about knitting and crochet . i m beginning to learn more about spinning . i am happy for these three subjects to be my primary areas of research and learning . for the rest of my interests , i m happy to enjoy them without knowing too much . i can sew a few pieces of material together and thereby i quilt i can put one foot in front of the other slightly faster than i may walk and thereby i run . i do nt really want to wonder or worry too much more about it and i do nt need too until i need to
over the years i have run into many businessmen who make the statement , whenever i get things in order in my business , i want to get more involved in ministry . what are these men really saying they are saying that as soon as they can get the amount of money that creates security , they will trust god . they are saying that what they have been doing to date has not been ministry . this separation of work and faith is common among our culture . we fail to understand that life is sacred to god and there is nothing holy and nothing sacred in itself .
as we were rolling through the club district , we happened to spot a car in reverse backing down the street at a pretty high speed . we watch it drive backwards about three quarters of a city block to slide into a parking space , and as soon as the driver parallel parks it , i pull up next to it and block it in , hitting the lights while my partner puts the stop out over the air . as he 's doing that , i get out and introduce myself to our latest customer , a black male about years old who is nervous as all hell .
talk about an eye opening moment . that did it for me . i talked to hubby , who simply said no kid should go hungry . . and he was n't talking about kerri . so i wrote a note in kerri 's school agenda to her teacher . i told her what was happening , what kerri told us , and offered to provide snacks for the classroom to prevent this from happening . i wanted to send some right away , but hubby asked me to wait for the teacher 's reply . so i ended my paragraph with please tell us how we can help . .
what have i learned from the experience mainly i 've learned how to tell when not to write . in the first few days of the marathon , there was a really hot spell and during the early afternoon which is usually when i finish getting up in the ' morning ' it was just too hot for me to concentrate . there were also a couple of days where i was just too agitated about something or too interested in something else to concentrate on writing , and for the first time i was able to spot that in time to stop trying to write before i got frustrated .
i 'm thankful that i see my mom several times a week , talk to her a dozen times a day , and have her and my father care for my children when i 'm at work . i 'm thankful i have an equally amazing grandmother and grandfather who also take care of my children , my house , and me , every week . i 'm thankful i have a mother in law and father in law who cook amazing food for my children , take them to and from school , and look after them , when i 'm working my to shift , monday to friday .
think about what you do . what are your activities do you travel , do you play sports what do you do really think about what the things in your day to day life that you 'd like to photograph . if you like to be in nature , would you like to photograph nature a lot . if you live downtown , are you interested in taking pictures of the amazing architecture around you . there are people who are turning the mundane into beautiful . that 's the first place to start . where you are and what you do may turn into what you like to photograph .
i 've been drinking this for breakfast for the past weeks and have lost pounds . on the box they want you to use it twice a day but i 'm not one of those people that can have a shake for breakfast and a shake for lunch . it keeps me full and it 's very helpful that it has all the protein and minerals you need in one day . i think it makes a great breakfast and i think i will continue to try all the flavors . if your wanting something to keep you satisfied until lunch , try this i think you ll like it .
my kids are only little once . i do n't want to miss their special things because i am caught up in editing . i have to spend time with my husband i need time for myself i have to get sleep i have to eat . bottom line , i have to take care of myself and my family . both physically and mentally . honestly , i do n't know any secrets about how this needs to be done . i only know what i try and try my best to do . that is make my family happy , keep myself happy and keep my photo clients happy .
today was a hard day too , but i had my first good dream and by that i mean i do nt have many dreams and most of the time my dreams are about me having fun before my mission and then i wake up and realize i 'm really on a mission and ca nt do that for the next years . oh but i read some cool stuff in alma today i love the things you can learn from the scriptures read alma and then i found out that aaron copies exactly what alma did in the way they teach it was so cool to see how that worked .
. yesterday , to celebrate the last day of school , all the kids in preschool went to the local playground in town and i went along to snap some photos . i never thought it would be so difficult . they run and run , all of them , all at the same time , with no direction in mind . the playground looked like an anthill . i tried to make some group shots but and year old kids are not able to stand still long enough , let along able to look into the same direction , all at the same time , not even for maybe seconds .
when the bad stuff happens to you , it 's time to make a choice . i wo n't be the one to tell you to keep going the only one who can decide that is you . but you must choose a path . when you get here , to the really hard stuff , you ca n't stand at the fork in the road without losing it . choosing a path makes it a little easier , because you 're going somewhere again . maybe it 's not how or where you want to go , but it 's something . and sometimes that something can turn into loveliness .
when i came home i was determined . i thought i can do this . and m had said that i deserve the truth , that i have a right to find out . so i wrote an email to my aunt . i told her about my curiosity that had awakened within me , i asked her if she could tell me more about my grandparents . where they were born , what they worked with etc . and i told her that my mother wo nt say anything because she says she ca n't remember . and i asked her does she know why she says she ca n't remember
petunia was given to me in may to raise after she was separated from her mother . she 's now years old and has her own baby born around may th , . petunia is semi wild , meaning that she still visits me , allows me to touch her , eats corn from my hand , and , if given the opportunity , will clean my arms and hands . she treats me as her mother and at certain times of the year will visit my cabin daily . other times , usually fall and winter , i might not see her for a week or two at a time .
you can also make multiple books that you can attach to each other . for instance , with each of my children s books , i have a book with the name of the project that has all my notes and drawings and to do s for that single project . but i wanted a second book attached to that project that had all my research on that only that one project . so i attached a second book to it . so when i select that book project i want to work on up pops up both books and i can keep my research separate from the other business information .
when you re young , you re trying out who you are like a good suit . so , sometimes you do nt even see what s right in front of you . you re too focused on what you could have or on where you might be going , instead of enjoying where you are . if someone , right in front of you , is loving you with their whole heart , the way they know how that s at the very least worth investigating and seeing through . it may not be the one , but if you both learn from the experience it s ultimately a good thing .
therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock . the rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall , because it had its foundation on the rock . but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand . the rain came down , the streams rose , and the winds blew and beat against that house , and it fell with a great crash .
being true to yourself , being different than what the world expects of you is extremely difficult . you are not just fighting an inner struggle , questioning if staying true to yourself is the right path , but also fighting the world , which wants you to be the same as every other type of person , and to think like everyone else . this is not a fight which you win and move on , but a fight which stays with you your entire life , no matter how successful you become , or how many times you prove them wrong . that is why it is the hardest battle .
the mother drove me to the hospital at .am in the morning as the pain was getting worse , and i wo nt bore you with the details of child birth but you were born about hours later . the first time we had skin to skin contact was probably the highlight of my life i ca nt describe that feeling for you , it s just overwhelming and till today , i can still feel that first contact we had it was by far the greatest feeling of my life your touch , your sense and even your smell i knew you were going to be the love of my life .
the last two days have been hard . the one spot i had gone to for comfort just is nt there anymore . not in the way i am used too at least . he calls it tough love i guess , trying to do what s best for me . i just call it missing him badly . funny thing is that when i first started writing , i sent him the link . i do nt know that he has ever been here . probably better that way . i have always hated anyone seeing my weakness and almost hate that he has my heart as tightly as he does .
so , as most of you know , i spend a good deal of time at the gym . now , many people go to the gym for many different reasons , some to get in shape , some to get looked at , and some because they enjoy working out . there are , of course , many more reasons people go as well , but that s not the point of this post . at the gym the other day i heard someone say , i burned , calories , so i m gon na go chug down some ice cream and maybe a slice or two of pizza before my magic
that 's not all i did n't do . this year i did n't write cards . i did n't make cookies with my best friend and sing songs with family . i did n't make a giant dinner with them , eat too much , and watch white christmas while everyone chatted over coffee . i did n't stare at my cousins , and note how their faces have changed grown . i did n't go to the mountains and stare out at the white peaks , hot chocolate in hand . these are just a few of my traditions that define the holidays . love . friends . family . memories .
and now for the cake part . this is a delicious cake and it 's my comfort food for days , when i take exams and realize that i 'll fail them . i could also eat it every single day . i buy it in the supermarket and it 's really cheap , compared to other cakes less than for a piece . last year , when i discovered it , i could only eat a half of it in one sitting , but now i can devour it whole , by myself . i ca n't even wait until after lunch , i usually just eat it while i 'm cooking .
this is an opportunity for you to ask some questions and to share your thoughts parents as you re driving in the car somewhere with your family play this game . think of things you re sure will happen each day . for each thing you think of , have your child think of something he or she believes about god . for example , you might say that the sun will set tonight or that you will go to work tomorrow . your child might say , god loves me or jesus lives in heaven . talk about the certainty of each statement and what it means to have faith in god .
i believe what katie saw was real . i 've had similar experiences myself . they 're always subtle enough that they could be explained away as tricks of the mind or wishful thinking , but i do n't think so . i 'm a level headed and rational science guy , but i know there are things out there that science ca n't explain . i may have my doubts about god sometimes , but i do believe in angels . jill was an angel in life , and i truly believe she 's still here in some form . call me crazy , but i believe that with all my heart .
can i tell you that i love books books and magazines even in this technology stage i love to be able to hold a book or a magazine in my hands . if i could i would buy magazine a book or two or three every chance that i got . when it comes to reading books for pleasure i would usually check them out from the library but when it comes to reference coffee books i usually would buy them when they are on sale . well , there are few books that i have been eyeing and with my birthday in a month i am thinking of a great present for me
what i ve discovered over the course of these past two years is a lot , including most importantly , my passion for writing . i guess you can say i had my own kind of coming out in the sense that i let my hidden passion for writing become part of my public , professional life . i had buried my love for writing over the years throughout school , i thought that people would look down on me when i said i wanted to be an artist or a writer . so i covered up these thoughts of mine and went on studying other subjects in order to feel accepted by others .
on saturday i was supposed to run miles with my group in vancouver but i was out late the night before ok , maybe pm or so , but that s late for me and my cold was creeping in on me . when i woke up for my am run i could nt imagine driving to vancouver , so i slept in . eventually i did get out for a run , around in the afternoon , but i ran . miles and not . that s what happens when i plan my own route and run by myself . a few other things happen when i plan my own route , such as
having played heroes of might and magic for years , i was looking forward to the new game . not so much because i wanted a new town , or new creatures , i mean heroes was the perfect game in every way . i skipped the fourth since i could not handle that my hero could be killed in combat way too much pressure for me and played the fifth when that arrived . heroes is a good game , but the maps are too small and a lot of the abilities are useless since you do not get them before you have won the game , because the maps are too small .
it 's not to say i do n't think of that day , i do . who would n't but i no longer question that day . i allow that day to be what it is and i do n't let it define who i am . i do n't let it define my daughter 's life . because that 's the thing .. i know she died .. i am reminded of it everyday .. but what i want to remember and i want the world to know is that she lived . she lived and she loved and i am thankful everyday for those months and days she was allowed with me .
on the other hand , i do love the theme i chose for this year and the subjects i 've explored and i know a lot of you have enjoyed it as well . i 've appreciated your positive feedback so much because it 's shown me without a shadow of a doubt that what publishers have been saying for years is wrong . fantasy is still alive and well in the hearts of readers . we have n't lost our love of all things wide and wonderful , but it certainly does seem to me that the fare being offered to us in the fantasy genre in recent years has been less than inspiring .
so there once was a time , early on in my career , when i offered representation to an author and i did nt really have any good references in that genre to provide . i actually do nt even remember who the client was anymore , but i do remember that she said oh that s ok , i spoke to a friend of mine who met you at a conference and she said you were fabulous , and also that you were tiny i included the tiny part so you would know i m not making this up , even though the fabulous part totally sounds like something i would say about myself .
i really do nt feel any differently about trading in this way than i do about investing in mutual fund , stocks , whatever . if you put in today and price drops , you ride it out for the longer term . i do the same thing . just because it s trading does nt mean i do nt hold positions for as long as i need to . so , when brazil does this or china does that and gold drops oz , then it s not a big deal . now , if it drops another , then another , then another , at some point it obviously becomes a bigger deal .
the next time we were both at church we found each other and started talking again . he asked me if i wanted to go to lunch afterwards with him and the large group he was going with . they happened to be going to the same place that my family was going , which i told him . my mom and sister , being the wonderful people that they are , insisted i sit with eddie and his group instead of with them . when we had finished eating eddie walked me to my car and asked for my phone number so that he could call me and take me out on a date .
. keep in mind that an expensive , well constructed shoe made of quality materials is not always guaranteed to be comfortable . a beautiful shoe is a work of art , but a comfortable shoe is a work of architecture , and the two do n't always go together . whenever i 'm interested in a brand i have n't worn before , i always make sure to do plenty of research and read the online reviews first . there are plenty of brands out there that offer both style and comfort , so make sure you 've done your homework lest you drop a lot of cash on a pair of beautiful torture devices .
however , that does not mean that life has stopped . not at all people are still creating families and are still getting married and have babies . may is the month that the wedding season begins . fear not my ladies you do n't need to spend a fortune to a dress that you will wear for a couple of hours and never again in your lifetime . the high street retailers have some very beautiful alternatives for you that you can still wear after the big event . besides , it is not a custom anymore for the wedding dress to pass over to the next generation , so keep it affordable and wear it again
i must confess , i am still in job yes , job . i am stuck on the dialogue between job and his friends in the first few chapters . i want to understand it and figure out what it all means and it 's been slow going for me . i do hope you 're doing better than me with the reading the bible in one year challenge the way i see it , it 's a good idea to keep up , but also to understand what i 'm reading . to that end , i am behind right now according to the schedule , but perhaps there will be another time to catch up .
just now the night vs day ratio is rapidly increasing and this seems to be throwing some people off with regards to when it 's okay to be out on your bike and when it is n't . as a car driver i 'm legally required to have working lights and to use them when the conditions call for it . unlike cars , bikes do n't legally require lights , however , a working light must be on when cycling at night . simple i 'd say so . except given the number of morons i 've seen in the last week cycling around at night with nothing to allow them to be seen is unbelievable .
most of the time i stress the long term processes of transformation the journey , the quest of the hero . it s a model that reflects the nature of life and our need to respond , learn , and adapt to the ups and downs and to ultimately come to terms with the nature of life and death . when we re serious about creating lasting change , whether it s to do with our health , relationships , career or anything else we know that it s the quality of our habits , the choices we make day in day out that will determine whether we build the of deeply fulfilled life or something else .
i have long admired jenny 's works , but this quilt really took my breath away . to give you and idea of the size of this quilt , i was at a quilt show earlier this year and as i walked between the rows , a man standing at the end of the row caught the corner of my eye and i did a double take . it was n't actually a man , it was this quilt , hanging at the end of the row . when you stand looking at the quilt , he is basically life sized and the way the quilt was hung meant that you were looking at him in the eye .
the surprising fact is , i feel more powerful in general as a result of having and overcoming panic . if you have nt suffered from panic , depression or deep grief and there are few of us who avoid these throughout our lives you may not have realised the incredible ability of your mind to take control , recover and eventually become even stronger . if you re suffering from these experiences now , you can look forward to learning this for yourself . yes , it s hard to believe but , if you ask for help and take responsibility for your thoughts , one day you can look back on your struggle as a gift .
we went to sesame place in the beginning of september and in the beginning of june . both times were a blast for both the adults and the kids . in , we went with our year old and year old and basically our year old had a blast and our year old did n't have too much to do , but it was still fun for him . this past june , both our year old and year old had a blast . the parade was really fun they got to high five some of the sesame street characters and a year old who was with us got to dance with some of the characters during the parade .
i like texas , and i 'm not here to dog on my home , but it 's not that pretty here . it 's flat and i love hills and mountains . it 's dry and i love rivers and oceans . it 's nice in an average sort of way . i want to live here . i love people more than i love pretty places and the people i love are here . but sometimes i need to see beautiful places in the world , to be reminded of god in the way that is most satisfying to me . i miss that now that i m home . it might be what i miss most .
i eat right , i workout days a week , but i swear , like other girls , i can pick out things i find wrong with myself . i listen to my friends and family do the same thing and i always think you are crazy girl , i do nt know what mirror you are looking at but then i ca nt say the same to myself . i am sure its the week prior to my lovely time of the month when i am always criticizing every inch of my body , but its starting to drive me nuts . i can go from being super confident one day , to the exact opposite the next .
. the cds that i make for my friends . but i do nt make them for just anybody only the people who i really care about and the people who really care about me because i m pretty protect over my music . and how for a split second when i finish a cd i really do feel like i created something new even though its just a mix of all my favorites . i just love making mix cds for people . if i make one for you that means i really care about you . i m not great with words so the music also might be trying to tell you something that maybe i ca nt
as far as my weekend update is concerned , it was a time to try to get our home and ourselves back to normal . i can once again see what 's in my refrigerator so many people brought food for us , we could n't find anything in there . the hospital equipment is gone . now there 's a big empty room where the pool table is supposed to go . i 'm hoping we ca n't find anyone to move it back in i'd love love love that room to be a music reading whatever place . hubby did agree to leave it as is , so for now , it 's a practice and exercise room .
in my friendships i 'm trying to get better , and i think they are all good , wonderful people who love me , and i love them . i want to be able to show them that i care about them , and i want to be certain they really care about me also . i 'm learning not to focus on myself so much , and to allow them to share themselves with me , and not make it about me in the process . that is a big admission i made that admission forever ago . it is what it is , and i am who i am . i know me , can many people say that
can all five readers be right i think it 's impossible for any of them to be wrong , as it happens . when a reader gives you their response to something , you have to accept it they ca n't be wrong about their response . but what the example shows is that you ca n't please all of the people all of the time . i am in the process of going through the book again looking for obnoxiously long passages of dialogue and blank rooms , but i 'm not looking very hard i 've more than satisfied of my readers so far statistics are fun , are n't they , so it ca n't be that bad .
it is an invisible word . we use it so frequently and are so used to seeing it , that we barely notice its use when we read it or write it . it takes a good editor to look beyond the expected to what is and find the its that make our writing so hazy . see all my its makes me seem like a lazy writer , and normally that would be true , but it was very difficult using so many its in such a short time , but i needed all these its to make a point . it has its place , but most often , a more specific word would make the writing come alive .
. at the prison , you will notice there 's a crack in the wall also marked with a red square in picture . it opens like a door does , so do that and follow the path down till you see a man . talk to him and he explains he 's the real king , survived because the servant in the prison is deaf and did n't hear the orders not to feed him , they think he 's dead , blah blah blah . after done talking with him , chat once more and then head back to your cell . the queen should be waiting for you . make sure your party is at full health by now
i need lots of ' emotional intelligence ' today . i know i need it when my girl tells me to go and read it yourself when i asked her to go through her work which i had market and added little pointers to help her . i felt like shouting back at her about how rude she was and how much effort i had put in it and how that makes me feel like not helping her in her work again and i did to a certain extent so i know i need ' emotional intelligence in order to teach her to have self control . heck if i ca n't control myself how can i expect her to control herself
so the love you have for being what you are and who you are at this moment of the now is important . you will see you . you can say i love all that is me and makes me what i am now . focus on the things that are in your mind obstacles to love your self . i hate my belly , i am so bossy , i am so rude , i am so ugly , etc . all you have thought about now will be loved by you . see and feel that what you do not love about you and tell it is loved and will be loved always . it is a part of you .
however , the first minutes of the movie is real footage that a group of japanese captured from a hillside . you watch this water roll in . and roll in . and roll in some more . you think it s going to stop , but it never does . you listen to these people screaming for their lost family members because they know that their family members are now under that water somewhere . you watch these people running up the hill to try and get away , only to have them sucked up by the wave . it leaves a mark . it left such a mark on me , i ca nt even think about it without getting upset .
since about th or th grade i have called myself a christian . we usually went to a non denominational church and i went to youth group . i prayed at dinner with the whole family and i sang those fun , yet cheesy kid worship songs . as i got older , my faith increased . i became more aware of my sins and wanted to have a close knit relationship with god . unfortunately , i could never get that feeling . something was missing . i started reading my bible every night . i prayed . i went to church . i gave money to the church . all of that , and i still did nt have that feeling .
after talking to her for a few minutes about the position , i told her yes this was a job that my friend a heard about from her friend l . l had worked with a friend g for a while and g later took a new job at a different office but g and l still stayed in touch . are you following me here so , g had been at her new job for about a year . g is pregnant and decided that she would be staying at home with her baby instead of returning to work , so she was helping in the search to find her replacement so that person could start early enough so g could train them .
you see , if you play down religion and play up god , we will be doing great works for humanity . and so , i have written songs like your god is my god , mustapha and christopher in recent times and it s also included in my upcoming album . mustapha meaning muslims and christopher meaning christians . singing the boy called mustapha , like the moon and star are far . he was brought up to be forever far from that christopher . this they called religion . but if we listen to nature s call and do nt let religious differences make a wall , then mustapha and christopher will live together . this is my religion and my message .
i 'm so thankful for him so thankful that he talked me into getting out of the car and walking into that building so that god could begin tightening us back together . we were falling apart in some ways and did n't even know it . and we still have a lot of work to do , but i do believe that sunday june th was an important night in our marriage . i love josh and i could n't imagine life without him . and i know that god is working in his life in ways that are unknown to me and that 's ok . i 'm not supposed to be in control . i 'm not supposed to be the leader .
lately , i have been thinking about what my life would have been like had i chosen a different path in life . i never thought of being a business major in college . but lately i have wondered if i should have been a business major . or a doctor or anything other than a graphic designer artist . i should have listened to my father when he told me i would n't make as much money as i thought i would . he was n't discrediting my abilities . he just thought i could make more money doing something else . and unlike me , he knew i would n't be happy with less money . oh dad 's they are so smart .
as part of the work we do with people and organizations that need clarity , and in asking the right questions , we empower them to learn , communicate and make their difference in all they do . part of this work is understanding what a true opportunity is . i will share it with you here . a true opportunity is anywhere you are needed and wanted . both have to be in place for an opportunity to be present . there are people in your life that need you but do nt want you . likewise , there are people in your life that want you but do nt need you . the key is to be where you are needed and wanted .
one thing that i have had to share with my family and friends this year is the idea that homeschooling is not just about school . it is about life . homeschooling is not just doing the math , reading , and writing in our house instead of in the building down the road . homeschooling is a lifestyle i 've chosen in order to support the goals i have for my children . this is what i want to get across to those out there who can not understand my reasons for wanting to keep my children with me through the day . there is a much bigger picture i have in mind when i plan out each and every one of our days .
the numbers meant more than the words and the smaller numbers meant more than the bigger ones . it was like we belonged to our own little country and we had this secret language that almost nobody else understood . almost nobody can tell you the real difference between and . almost nobody understands that there 's something in there , something important and significant , just waiting to be released out of that space between the six and the nine . put it this way if you ever wanted to cross over that gap , if you ever wanted to see what it was like on the other side , you would need to change your entire life and get rid of almost everything else .
being that its mothers day on sunday its a reminder for me about all that my mum does for me every call for help , advice on baking and other things , washing , showers , place to call in for a coffee and chat , being around for my children and it reminds me of my friends and also being aware to love others and have compassion and sympathy and helping because as a mum myself you ca n't do life alone . others are in our lives for the laughs , good times and bad . friends get us through those days you feel like nothing is working and are our sounding boards when a stain just wo nt come out of our favourite top
so tonight we had joe 's back to school conference . like an open house meet your teacher , only we had a scheduled time . we got to bring all of his stuff in and get it situated for when he starts school next week . we signed all of the emergency information , got his pin number for lunch which he 's keeping under lock and key because they told him he was n't supposed to share it with anyone , and went to the book fair . do you want to know the most impressive thing that happened during all of this you 'll never guess . i did n't cry . that 's right . i held it together . for today anyway .
you 've seen a very similar outfit to this one before , but i had to post it again to show you this coat , which has been a lifesaver during our cold , rainy spring . what 's interesting about this jacket is that although i bought it in i remember because my sister was visiting at the time and helped me pick it out , it seems to get more and more current as the years go by . the bold , graphic floral print and mix of colors seem very fresh to me , and i 've worn it a ton over the last couple of months . if i saw it in a store today i 'd surely buy it all over again .
even in writing this i feel like i 'm getting on to her , but in reality i 'm pointing out my own flaws . i feel like i 'm going about this all wrong . i feel like i 'm a bad parent . if i 'm not ready to take care of someone else 's child , how could i ever be a good parent to my own maybe i should n't have kids . maybe that 's why god has n't given them to me yet . because i 'm not supposed to have my own . maybe i have n't shown him yet that i deserve that gift , and now i never will . because i 'm doing so badly with breanna .
years would go by , and i would think of him , from time to time , feeling guilty as well that i have given up , upon faith , so i would try to seek god , and try out some church . then when i would find a church and either i was nt feeling comfortable , thinking that people where judging me or the message would never hit me , speak to me . so i would give up and just return to a life without christ . but what is really was , was that i was nt ready nor committed to becoming one of christ s followers . giving up all the things i though at the time , made me happy .
i finished my class this morning , and i 'm so excited to have the rest of the day free well , besides doing homework . i have to write a news story about a really cool event i visited yesterday an art exhibit . it made me realize that i 'm very interested in art and how there are so many different forms of it out there . to get into the specifics , i went to a fiber art show , which displayed fabrics and other types of art . i almost signed up for a fiber art class for this winter , but now i 'm definitely interested in signing up for it next year for now , i can stick with writing about it .
i was listening to the radio this morning and the song i can only imagine came on . i continued to drive and thought a lot while the song played . then i thought , i ca n't imagine . i ca n't imagine what i 'll do when i get to heaven . i know i 'll be in awe of god and jesus and of all that heaven is . but more than anything , i just want to see you and be with you when i get there . yes , i am grateful that jesus is the reason that heaven is attainable for me . and yes , i am grateful , so grateful , for everything god has carried me through in life .
i know this post is kind of rambling , but i do n't know how to fully connect all of my thoughts right now . i 'm just sad . i miss anna . i hate that someone who loved life was taken out of this life so young . anna was very religious and loved god so there is no doubt in my mind that she is in heaven right now . but at the same time , as much as she loved god , i also know that she did n't want to die this young . she had plans for the rest of her life that she will never be able to complete . she had hopes and dreams that will now never come true .
my birthday was last week and one great thing about having a birthday is all the free stuff you can get . i 'm not just talking about gifts from friends and relatives , but gifts from many restaurants . so i though i 'd share the best restaurants with birthday clubs you can sign up for online and get free stuff coupons . most places will e mail you the coupons a week before your birthday and they are good until a week after your birthday , so you have weeks to fill up on free food . after all the eating out we 've been doing the past couple weeks , i may need to up my workout routine birthday calories do n't really count though , right
if there 's one thing i ca n't do , it 's figuring things out . at least , i do n't feel like i can . when i was younger , probably in high school , i tried really hard to know what i wanted to do with my life , but i never really planned it out . i definitely was not one of those girls who knew by what age she wanted to get married and then have children . trust me , the whole concept was lunacy to me . i did , however , always know that i wanted to be a teacher or work with children in some capacity . so , i guess you could say i tried to figure it out .
in this season in my life , when i want to push the pain away i am more and more feeling the presence of my god pushing me to embrace it ... to enter in and to feel it . the greatest compassion comes from a heart that has known pain . though uncomfortable , i am honored to share in his suffering . i pray that he continues to use my pain for his good and for him to give me the courage and strength to enter into the pain of others and show them the comfort he has shown me . february might be a tough month for us but it is also a sacred month ... i know his grace will be enough ... it always is .
my son has a busy social life i always joke that it is much better than mine which may actually be completely accurate and not entirely a bad thing for him . but this means that he 's often got more interesting things to do then spend time with me , or is not available to talk . this really , really is fine and perfectly normal , i so want him to be getting on with things and enjoying himself , i do n't want to stand in the way of that . i still ca n't help being a little upset by it sometimes . i guess this is a purely selfish reaction on my part but nevertheless it 's something else i try not to think about .
the truth is that i do n't think anyone noticed at first , and for a long while . i think that , when you 've acted one way for a long time , people do n't quite believe you when you start to change . it was during that time , when i was really struggling with that , that i wrote changing when you ca n't . because what i wanted to say , really , was i 'm trying . i 'm really trying , and i wanted someone to see it and acknowledge it and say i get it . keep going , it 's working . but nobody said that , and it was sometimes hard to keep going when i felt like nobody believed me .
it does nt really matter what the situation is , a choice has to be made and choices have consequences . do you always make good choices no , so why should your character do you ever do something out of character yes so why ca nt your character when i started writing the female protagonist in my book she s called jennifer by the way , jen to everyone bar her dad i stuck her in situations and got her to do things go here , pick up that , put it down . i treated her a bit like a character out of the sims . she did nt have much of a personality . i m not saying she had no personality just not a well developed one .
that would have to be to just do it . i have this problem with my son all the time . he will sit there and stare at a blank piece of paper for hours trying to get the words to come to him . it 's painful . i have to tell him all the time to just start writing and the words will start to work themselves out . yes , he may have to go back and re work some of the beginning because he was n't warmed up , yet , but that 's better than just sitting there . he always says how that will never work until he actually does it , so he always has to come back and tell me i was right .
as humans we are playing gods over everything and everybody what is in the realm of our power . as scientists we are playing gods over our objects of research as parents we are playing gods over our children as managers we are playing gods over our employees . when we are playing god over our dog the dog is trying to figure out what we are demanding from him in order to accommodate our demands and make his life easier when we are playing god over our child he she is learning how to behave to make the life more enjoyable when we are playing god over somebody who is working for us this person is accommodating our demands to make his work more productive and therefore to make more money .
good morning everybody i hear it is cold in many different places already and here in texas our mornings have been a little cold too right now we are f i know that 's not even cold for some people lol but anyways i just want to start the week with a happy thankful thought just like i am trying to do every morning and praise god for something and today i just want to praise him for his creation thank god for seasons , changes and for chilly mornings you , whoever you are , if you are reading this post it means that you have a computer and that makes me assume you have shelter , so i guess we both have something to be thankful for do n't you think
. buy small amounts for birthdays and holidays for the first few years . the first few years , parents get really excited and go crazy buying way too much . when you add in what they will get from other people , you just get an overwhelming mess . i bought very few toys because i knew they 'd get presents and even though i did this , we still ended up with too much . i wrapped up socks , underwear and clothes along with the toys so they 'd have something to open . ian will still say,wow , new socks little ones get bored opening presents and then they like to play with the box . you only need a few presents to open when they are small .
in america s economy went into a recession and many people found themselves without a job . america s economy is getting increasingly better as time passes but unemployment rates are still high . since the unemployment rates are high in america many people are turning to college to make themselves appeal to employers more . having a college education has almost completely become a necessity in finding a job and becoming employed . considering this , is college debt still considered good debt personally , yes , i believe it is . i know that not everyone goes on to receive a college education therefore a college education still helps with finding employment . i would like to see your viewpoints about this topic in the poll and comments section below .
there was once a boy . the boy had books at home , torn and tattered books but they were good books . he was nt looking specifically for a book when he stumbled on the library , he s always liked the library , and he loved to just hang out there . in fact , he loved the library so much he often asked his sister to come to the library with him . the sister was popular with all the other books , they liked her because she could give them enough attention , whether or not she understood the story . the boy did nt mind . he enjoyed the library and the books , it was always a nice place to be , a place to rest .
partners each pick a heart out of a valentine 's gift bag . each partner counts their coins and writes it on their line . then the partners decide if a greater than or less than sign should go in the circle . the player with the larger amount wins that round . after putting the coins back in their heart and putting it aside , they each draw another heart out of the bag and follow the same procedure for the second round . after rounds , the player who won the most rounds is the winner just make sure when you put the coins in the hearts that you make them all different amounts . you do n't need numbers on the hearts unless you want to make an answer key .
i chose to write michael because i wanted to explore how it felt to live through a situation without resolution . at the time , someone i knew was fighting cancer , a life of illness , treatment , remission , illness , treatment , remission , then illness again . i also knew someone who had suffered severe brain damage . in both cases , these were people i cared about , but both of them were loved by people i loved . in both cases , it was wrong to give up hope , but in some ways hope was more difficult than acceptance . since i did n't want to write anything too specifically about these people , i chose to explore the dilemma by writing about a missing person .
originally , i was going to be away from home until , at which point my parents would nt really want me sending an email . i was going to a different church s youth group . after walking out of that room and coming to that realization , though , i knew there was no way on earth that would happen . i really ca nt explain that finalization of thought . going home early to tell em i was there for her and i would love her no matter what was nt just one option on my list . i had to . that conviction was from the holy spirit and i knew it . it felt so strong , so compelling . it was a desire i could nt even fight .
on another random note , i really want to loose weight i 'm talking about pounds . i really need to , i used to weigh right at pounds and now i 'm around , i have to admit that i do carry it well . but , i 'm over this weight and really wish i could stick to a diet and exercise routine . my problem is i love to eat , and i 'm a little lazy . this summer i 'm looking forward to rocking some cute little short shorts , and tanks but i 'm going to have to get my weight under control . i 'm not against taking diet pills , so if anybody knows of any over the counter weight loss pills please let me know .
i told my class about this , and they all seemed very supportive of the idea , especially those who have missed most or all of recess as a result of the above mentioned reasons . of course , today was also the day that i had a meeting at , so i had a sub come in at that time , and there was no time for her to go over what i had asked her to teach if she was going to be taking them outside for recess fifteen minutes after she arrived . so today did nt actually work out as planned , but hey , that s life , right if we do nt get to the new schedule changes this week , we ll definitely be able to start next monday
oh , definitely . writing seems to be about the only thing i know how to do from start to finish , so i m sticking to it i currently have another project on the drawing board . without giving too much away , i have found that writing about medical things is quite fun . i know there are about two dozen medical shows on tv right now , and you d think they d run out of stories , that a guy can only break his leg in so many ways , but the truth is , the possibilities are endless . every person s experience is different . the great thing about medicine fiction means my crazy imagination can create some pretty wild things as long as everything makes sense on the page .
john dear friends , let us love one another , for love comes from god . everyone who loves has been born of god and knows god . whoever does not love does not know god , because god is love . this is how god showed his love among us he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him . this is love not that we loved god , but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins . dear friends , since god so loved us , we also ought to love one another . no one has ever seen god but if we love one another , god lives in us and his love is made complete in us .
the more accepting you are of yourself , the more you will feel accepting of other people . it can be challenging to accept that you re doing the best thing for you . especially when you have to tell someone no , because you are now putting them in a position where they have to come up with another option when they were looking to you for help . but remember this , every time you choose to do what someone else wants over what you know is right for you , you hurt yourself and them . when you do what s best for your soul , you do what s best for everyone involved . it s more important to do the right thing than to hurt yourself in fear of disappointing another .
now , i m not a fan of the system that is in place . nor am i happy with the way the sport is going about its attempt to change it but that s for a different discussion , one that i will have in the very near future . whatever system is in place however , needs to have buy in from all concerned athletes , coaches , media and fans because perception is reality to the masses whether it is reality or not . and currently the perception of track and field is that tremendous performances are the result of outside forces as much as they are from good old fashioned hard work because too many athletes that have had great performances have been found to have supplemented that hard work with something else
a little background is that i have been praying for someone to come to church for many many years , a few weeks ago this person came to church on their own and it was awesome and i was so excited . i know that god is using me to help her . i take every opportunity he provides to do that . today was something special . she came into town and we were talking and i offered to go to recovery with her . she gladly said yes . so i went to school then met her at the church . the whole time before hand i am just praying that god speaks to her and through steve and that if its his will , this is where she will find her peace and comfort .
i did n't buy anything new for this wall except for the prints . most of the frames i actually made back in the day once i laid everything out i picked my colors i wanted them to be . i wanted just a hint of blue to carry your eye along the wall , i spray painted the black frames and lucky for me the cream frames were already painted when i first made them i also really really wanted subway art on the wall to kind of mix things up , i made them as well tutorial here the mirror i also made and put the hooks on to give it a little more character . i love that this wall is the first thing you see when you walk in the door it makes me smile
i guess it was a phase i was going through . i know there were times when i was really nasty and rude to you , and i m sorry . i think most of those times i was just angry , not angry at you , just an angry kid . and you ended up having to deal with it . and i m sorry about that . but now i think i m different . and i do nt know if it had to do with growing up or moving over here or what . i just know that i m a lot more mature than i was before , and i like it . i m getting along better with you , and i like that too . patti finally smiled following that last part .
. in the last few years , though constantly excited about city center , i 've gotten involved with an incredible amount of other projects , sounds , bands , ideas and stuff that does n't quite fit under the blanket that this blog has become . i 'm writing over here at this new blog about any music i 'm making or helping anyone else make , records or events i think are important , everything , etc . it does n't really matter much i guess , it 's just another name for the same bunch of feelings that will be happening forever . i 'm keeping this blog and all the songs photos etc up , but this will be the last post i do . thanks for reading and good luck on that custom essay
there was the year i got really deep and gave up all potato products . do n't laugh , as a german american it 's literally in my blood to have potatoes at every meal . which i was doing , and having potato based snacks on the side . that was also the year that i decided and announced to my church group what i was giving up before realizing that i 'd be in germany over spring break , ie . during the middle of lent . that particular trip was an interesting one , but i am proud to say that i did not eat a single potato product in those days despite the numerous opportunities that presented themselves . i also lost something like lbs . win win . that was a tough year .
we are leaving on sunday for a week to go look for our new house . i am super excited about it except for the part about flying with small kids , or the almost hour drive from the airport to the hotel , or staying in a hotel for a week , or the packing oh the packing i do not like packing . i believe i have myself and the children packed and ready , my husband is on his own . i tried to get most of it done when my kids were sleeping but that does nt always work . like i said before i spend some quality time with them , then allow them to play alone so i can jam as much crap into a suitcase as i can as fast as possible .
i went to church for the second time this past week at a new church . it hurts to have to try to find a place of worship anywhere except with my children . but their dad being the worship leader still , at the church we attended before , and now dating another worship leader there , and with the backing of the church leadership , i just ca nt . the kids are happy there , their friends are there , so it seems only right they stay . it is hard to trust other adults to hold such influence in the lives of my children in a place where i do not feel welcome , and where i do not support leadership s decision to allow my husband to date , prior to the divorce being finalized .
still , i know of writers who were in the middle of a story and came across an already published book or movie that was so similar to theirs they stopped writing it . it happens . i 've read some books that were so similar i wondered if the authors were related or if one of them was influenced by the other . actually , there 's a few of those i 'll be wondering about into the next life . and it does make me worry some as i write . what if i 'm not unique enough i 'm not worried enough to stop writing . i did however , do checks on amazon and the library to see if i could see anything like what i was writing . well , agents do say to know your field ....
as i walked out the door with the nurse , she said , do you think she ll really go back i began to tear up . well , it s what she wants , but i ca nt see her being able to care for herself . believe me , i said , if i was a wealthy woman , i would put her in a little place of her own , with someone to care for her . just so she could go back . as i looked at the nurse , i could see she had tears in her eyes too . she had lost her mother years before , so i think we shared a common understanding of this sorrow . watching the decline of her own mother sounds difficult . she had a nurse coming in as well .
until the time comes for god to send his son , jesus , back to get his bride , it is up to each one of us as christians to allow others see a little glimpse of what god and his son , christ looks like through us . it is important that we notice god at work around us every day . the other day , my dog , smokey slipped and wrote about god s presence . smokey is so very right . we must acknowledge god in all that is around us . when we acknowledge in all of our surroundings , we see the most beautiful portrait of god and his son . we can also look in the mirror every day and see a beautiful image of god . after all , we are made in his image .
i m not sure if it s a lie that i tell myself or a lie that the enemy has convinced me to believe , but i struggle with thinking that i do nt read my bible enough , that i do nt pray enough , that i m just not good enough . while i do desire to grow in my walk with the lord , i know that my future is nt dependent on how often i pray , read my bible or how good i try to be that there s nothing i can do to make jesus love me more nor is there anything i can do to make him love me less . but in this performance driven world , it s too easy for me to begin to believe the lies that the enemy keeps telling me .
i was sexually abused repeatedly at the age of or by my mother s best friend s year old son . i have a sister that is months younger than me . it was when he began to go after her as well , that s when i went to my mother and told her . the abuse stopped and not another word was ever spoken about it ever . through my growing up years , i had to see this man time and again , each time our families got together . i do nt know that if my father ever even knew , and since both my parents are long dead , i will never know . now , this is something that i have always known that this happened to me . but , who is , or was , me
this version of batman is pretty good . it has a different story from all the other batman stories and a new villain . but it has really no back story to it . can you really call this part of the new anyone who does nt know who batman is or the back story on him is going to pick this up and ask what the hell is going on and who is this crazy guy in a bat costume but from the perspective of someone who has read batman before and knows the back story , it s a great read . it s a fresh new problem for batman to overcome . so my advice , if you have nt read batman , do nt read this as a start . go back and read some actual origin stories of batman .
first of all , i have to confess that i finished reading the great gatsby over two weeks ago , but have just not found the time to sit down and write my review . i read this book surprisingly fast and found the general pace of the book to be quick . it seems to be a bit of a strange classic to me . it certainly has something to say about the society in which the story takes place , but i m not sure that the great gatsby taught me as much about life and people as some of the other classics i have read . perhaps it s because i live in a very different world to the one of jay gatsby that i find his story hard to relate to but i m not sure that quite covers it .
when my mom was alive , she always had my back . no matter how rough our relationship was , she was always there , just in case . but then things got too rough for her , and she is gone now . i felt , last night , that i had no safety net , but i quickly realized that i absolutely do . not only do i have friends who are in this world to share a mutual love and support , but i have my own capabilities and resources , which are strong and have always come through for me . i have never spent more than two weeks looking for a job , and i will take anything that pays . when i come back from this trip , i will be okay . i will be more than okay .
attachment to the idea of what a love relationship should be like is probably why they so often fail . what should always be the goal of both persons is to keep the connection . allowing a person to his own mistakes , giving them the freedom to come and go and trusting your ability to deal with it if they choose the later is the most important aspects of non attachment you can practice . meanwhile keeping a healthy dose of the same connection to your own soul so that you know when behaviour is at the extreme and unhealthy end of the spectrum . you can love a person and not want to live with their destructive behaviour . you can love a person and not want them as part of your life . this is perfectly fine and in fact , vital .
i believe that if you do nt really find something interesting and can become fascinated with , you will never succeed at maintaining passion with that job . if your interest is chasing the mighty green dollar no matter what the job , than that is your fascination and that will keep you interested enough to succeed . if you love animals , then that is where you should be looking to find something that will keep you interested in what you do for the long term . if you chose a career that only works for you because there is a growing industry in that field but it does nt really interest you , you may have a career in that field , but i have a feeling , you may end up one of those people who feel empty in their lives down the road .
i have never experienced a tax free weekend before let me say it 's not very fun . i ca n't remember a time where i was running around so much . from one customer to the next , doing things at the same time ... insane why do people wait until the last minute to shop for school clothes i mean , it 's one thing to be out of town all summer but these people were coming in saying they were just here the past week or so . why did n't you shop then the entire store was off i bet you we had the sizes you were looking for but no , you come in tax free weekend when just about everything is regular priced you get upset that we do n't have your sizes . sorry people , your mistake ... not mine
henry jaglom well , it was a sold script in terms of action . but the dialogue was created by the people in the film , cause we knew each other and how we fit into each others lives . in always , i am not a very good cook . so when i tried to cook , i burnt that fish . it made her sick , so she could n't leave the house . it was a dramatic device , but it was n't real . but what we 're saying in the film , the emotion is real . what we 're saying dialogue wise is very real . it takes a lot of practice to tell the truth . but the stuff we 're saying to each other , and about each other is very real . i did n't wanna lose her .
the reason i enjoyed the movie is because it was nt short changing me when it came to emotional range and that s the problem with most male characters in romantic comedies . i do nt want to see a man fall in love with a girl to the point where he ca nt keep it together and loses damn near everything else in life , because that s not honest . i do nt want to see a man whose heart is so cold he ca nt manage to fall in love with the perfect woman even though she s staring at him right in the face , because that s not honest . and i definitely do nt want to see the movie where the man eventually gets the girl because he worked out whatever issues he had , because that s not honest either .
as i know that it s not just me , i wonder why a lot of really great women do nt let people know the real them no , i m not talking about the loud girl with the super high heels and too much makeup . i was that girl once too at instead of though , and believe you me , at that point , even i did nt know who i was . i remember talking a lot but not really saying much at all , and thinking that i needed to be tough talking to show that i was strong . i was so busy worrying about my weight and what people thought of me , i did nt even think of what i thought of me . and i knew nothing of what life was going to throw my way at the time .
it is a good bet that your child knows what makes you angry , how to get you even more fired up , and in what ways you are likely to react . for a young being who feels so little control in life , imagine how powerful that must make him or her feel , knowing they can bring you to the boiling point without much effort on their part . next , be aware of what your typical response to being angry is are you the kind of person who says or does things to make other people feel bad when you re angry are you likely to throw or kick things do you feel the need to discuss the event in minute detail at the time you and the other person are angry do you need to be alone , away from others when you are angry
but the fact of the matter is that maxi not being challenged meant he was board and that mean he did n't want to go to school , which in turn meant he and i was n't happy . so i felt i had to take this in hand and deal with it and it that means maxi being labeled as gifted and talented then so be it . i am concerned for the here and now , we can deal with next years education when it comes around . i need him to want to go to school now and moving him up a year is not the solution in my eyes . he is years old , he has the social skills of a five year old and he needs to learn to deal with his talents and also with his peers to become part of their group .
the third day we began to encounter some resistance . lizzy wanted to do everything all by herself and wanted no one in the bathroom with her , . only sometimes she would n't sit on the toilet long enough and would go as soon as she hopped down . also , i was totally stir crazy i had pretty much been sitting on the bathroom floor since friday morning . we went on a few errands while she wore a pull up . lizzy did a great job sitting on the toilet in public , but did n't ever actually go . she did end up going in her pull up without telling us , but i think that had more to do with the fact that we ended up staying out longer than anticipated and sort of lost track of time and waited longer than usual to take a bathroom trip .
beth i did nt really have a goal in mind for this race because i knew i needed to see how the weather would play out so my goal would be determined out on the course . somewhere in mile a man asked where the water stops were and i told him i had heard they were few and far between out here . in these miles i saw a man who is a regular with me in spin class and talks to me about my running . he asked me why i was nt further up and i told him i was trying ha . teal and i had decided we needed to take advantage of each water stop since we would nt know how the weather would be throughout the race . at the second water station we had to stop and wait for water to be poured in a cup for us .
so i got to spend the day in my bedroom with my blackout shades pulled . it s a beautiful day in alaska , and my eyes ca nt handle light . sigh . but my eye feels much better right now , and i can even see better than i could to start the day . it might have been relaxing except that my alarm has been constantly going off reminding me to put in my constant drops . and tonight i will even have to set my alarm for every couple of hours . but it s my sight we are talking about so i will totally obey the doctor s orders to the letter . i m ever grateful for my children , who have allowed me to take it easy and did nt complain when i decided that sight was required for cooking and that tonight we would eat cereal for supper .
if he does nt have any good answers , or you have already tried talking to him or simply feel like you ca nt , maybe you should get the divorce . just be sure that this is really what you want , and that this is really what is best for you and your family . before you suggest a divorce i would make sure that you have things in order . divorces can get ugly and i would hate for you and your children to fall on hard times because you re trying to get away from a bad situation . do you have family or friends that you can lean on look to your support system for help , and maybe even talk to the people you trust the most before you decide to go through with this , and if you do , talk to them about what you should do next .
at this point a couple of people noticed i was upset and asked if they could help . i gave them cameron 's description and kept on looking . fifteen minutes had gone by and no one had seen him . i finally let the tears come . i had lost my son . i was scared and of course all these horrible thoughts started to enter my mind . about ten more minutes passed and i finally found a police officer . i told him i could n't find my son . he asked what his name was and when i told him he said , he 's fine . he 's over by the information desk . a couple of ladies found him and brought him over . the information desk was at least a football field length away , maybe more . i wondered how far we had wandered before those ladies found him .
besides any of my amazing family and friends . i d have to start with jesus cause well , he s jesus . i m a religious guy and i could certainly think of a few topics of conversation . then i would add jimmy stewart to the mix . i m huge fan of his . he s that classic movie star that played the everyday man so well . also , i think he and jesus would hit it off . well , there likely old friends already , right finally , annie leibovitz would receive an invite as well . i m a wedding photographer as well as an actor . so , annie leibovitz is a sort of hero of mine in the photography realm . plus , she could take some kick ass pics of this outstanding dinner that i m sure i ll need proof of when i tell people about .
yet i struggle with where i am , where i will be , and where i should be . i 've always had lofty ideas for my life and i 've always wanted to start early with things like my career . heck , i 've been wanting to be a teacher since i was six which is years for those of you counting . it 's hard for me to take in the fact that i 've done everything i need to in order to get to that dream , yet i am still not there . i 've taken classes , i 've gotten my degrees , i 've graduated . i even got my foot in the door at a local school . but lately it all seems to be coming to a sudden stop . i do n't know where i will be next fall , or even where i will be wanted .
i also want to make it clear that i do n't , and did n't when i was still in my teens having just turned a couple of months ago , i still have trouble remembering i 'm no longer a teen , tell my parents everything . i 'm my own person , with my own life , and some things stay private . sometimes because it 's something very personal , or a secret not mine to share , and sometimes it 's because i know it would worry or upset them to know something . yes , occasionally i keep things and have kept things in the past i know my parents would disapprove of away from them , not because of any fear that i would get in trouble or anything like that , but simply because i do n't want them upset or worried about things they ultimately have no control over .
we have lost control over our basic information . i 'm sure that my name , address , dob , favorite foods , etc . are floating out on the web somewhere . more importantly , i did n't put some of them on the web , nor did i request that it be done . nevertheless , it is out there somewhere on the web for everyone to see . more importantly , i am not alone most of us are probably in the same boat . whether we care about it or not i personally am not overly worried about it , we have lost control of our information . we do not necessarily determine what people see and when they see it . the growth of the internet and social media have set us free in many ways however , it does come with a cost some loss of privacy and personal control of information .
because of this urge to get a job , i m faced with my demons . i am calling them demons because they re destructive . they are the noises in my head that tell me i m not good enough , that i may not be able to achieve what i wanted , or people wo nt hire me , etc . you name it these noises pull down my confidence , and as a result , i have fear in me mainly fear of failure . but all these are noises and feeling . they are not the real me . they are there because it s normal to have thoughts and doubts . it s part of being human to have all these doubt , emotions , and thoughts . i decided to befriend and welcome them . i do nt want to push them away , and just simply let them be what they are .
yeah , not even your mom . you do n't ' owe ' your parents anything when it comes to having sex , even if they think you do . they may have created that body , but they are n't the ones who are inhabiting it , and they are n't the ones who are going to have to live with whatever choice you make for the rest of their lives . however well they know you , they do n't know you any better than yourself . that means they ca n't make that decision for you . sure , take into account what they think you should do . have some respect if they say ' we do n't mind you having sex , but please do n't do it under our roof ' . but they do n't have the ability to decide when you 're ready or not . even if they think they do .
looking back on the past , i remember having relationships with people whom , at the time firmly believed that i was their one , and yet to me , at the back of my mind i did not fully believe that they were mine . but then i found myself wondering if i was basing that idea on the fact that i had a different definition of the one to them . was i in fact the one but just did not know it , or was i right to walk away and continue my search as time moved on i realised that what i was doing wrong was searching . whatever our definition of the one , i now have faith that whatever we believe the one is , we wo nt find them , they , like magic will find us and we will know one hundred percent that they are the one when we meet them .
that being said , i did have a few plans for my characters but some of them are already giving me the ol fuck you and doing something completely different . i d had a little bit of romance planned for much later in the series i m working on for the main character with someone who has nt been introduced yet , however , the chemistry between them and another character is growing with every little word i write . i do nt really mind it it just shocks me how letting my inspiration guide me and my characters do whatever is working so far all i did was add a little bit of dialogue to reference to the internet phenomenon most of us have probably participated in at least once before , shipping , a tiny little joke that i intended to go no where , and within a few lines , my exact thoughts were , as follows
your relationship will not always be picture perfect and whether you like or not , problems will come along . having a relationship problem does not necessarily mean that your relationship is doomed , but it does mean that more effort will be required to keep it together . most couples ignore their relationship problems , hoping it will go away on its own , or they make up but never discuss what happened or find ways to prevent it , which is why many couples suffer from chains of problems . some problems will be easier to handle than others and it often helps to get professional relationship advice . a huge amount of people have found expert advice helpful and useful in improving their relationship and finding wonderful ways to solve their problems and avoid future similar troubles . tackle your problems as soon as possible so your relationship can get back on track and continue to improve .
little did i know this was going to become a big mistake letting my guard down after being married for months i sensed that we were growing closer but little did i know she was playing with my heart , after a couple of months went by she started to seem different but i just gave her the benefit of the doubt and prayed to god , to help guide her through what ever she was going through i started to work over time to drawn in extra income so we could go on a trip for valentine s day a week before the trip i went to work as usual and got sent home because the work duty was light that day and they only needed a few workers so i took the day off excited to spend the rest of the day with my wife because we hardly had anytime together because of the extra hours i was putting in
as parents who love their children we want them to be healthy and we often jump right from that thought to food . we are deeply invested in what they eat , how much they eat and when they eat . perhaps we are missing out on the importance of why they eat . why do your kids eat what , how much and when they eat do your kids eat because they are hungry do your kids eat foods they enjoy do your kids eat as much or as little as feels right to them at the time or , do your kids eat because you have told them it is time to eat do your kids eat foods because you told them that they have to , or because they want to please you do your kids eat the amount you put on their plate because they know they have to eat it all do your kids eat to please you
beth to me some of this last half truly runs together because i was happy . i was constantly thinking you got this let s get it done it was also somewhere in here i spotted the hour pace and eventually passed him yes running through numbers in my head and somewhere in here i thought , wait a second , could i get a new pr today so i kept pushing . when mile came i knew i d put in a ton of work and my body could only take so much more pushing . i knew if i did pr it would be a close one and i thought if i do nt i do nt care . i ve run a strong race and i am so proud of myself it was kind of nice that teal and i happened to walk by the mile marker that morning as we made our way to the start and knew just where the finish was .
anyway , on the way to the test , gavin asked a very important question . he turned to me , and in the most sincere and innocent voice , said , mommy , i do nt know why , but i feel like i m ready to go take the test and i want to , but i feel a little worried . i do nt know why . my mommy rally speech went a little something like this that s completely normal , buddy . mommy is scared to do things all the time and i feel just like that , but i do them anyway . like when mommy spoke at that school recently , i was nervous , but i did nt let it stop me . i did it anyway , and the more you do stuff like that , even when you feel nervous , the easier it is to do more things like that . then you get really good at it .
on the ride home , i asked the children if they remembered hitting the door by accident . while they said no , i reminded them to be very careful when getting out of the car . even if they had hit the car , by that point , they probably would have been afraid to admit it . i tried to explain that the man was acting crazy because he was upset . when we are upset , we do not act reasonable . if you want something , you have to talk in a reasonable manner . my younger son brought up the incident throughout the rest of the day as we were reading together at night , he said once more , you should nt yell , right daddy you should nt act crazy . yes , that s right , i assured him . we get angry but yelling does not accomplish anything . ironically , yelling makes the words louder but not more clear .
some of us are extremely comfortable with our lives others are ok but could be better and there are yet those who wish they could wake up from this nightmare , but no alarm sounds off i have met people who can talk about money for hours , and what they are doing and who they work with etc . i have heard others who can talk about their diabetes medicine , or how many doctors visits they make , and how high gas , food , housing is , etc . why is this what determines how we occupy our time most people we meet are either secretly wishing to be rich or are actually openly trying to make the next dollar . i have heard many wealthy people say that poor people are lazy and do nt want to work and just make babies and do nt educate themselves etc . the list goes on , and people ask why should everyone have equal money and equal opportunity , and all that
it was quite a day . actually , quite a week . school was coming to an end and summer was just around the corner . i had plans to be helping out at the coffee shop and just like every year my birthday was the same weekend as the strawberry festival . and this year to add to the fun matt 's company planned a company party at the wings and waves water park on my actual birthday . yes , i think they did that on purpose so , my big day was packed . just the way i like it . the day was starting with me at the coffee shop . the strawberry fest was in full swing and it was a great day at the shop at about noon i hit the road and headed home to meet the family so we could make our way to the water park . we felt quite privileged to have our party there considering it was n't opening to the public until the next day .
if you are reading this post , you are reading my th slice of life story . yay when i began this challenge , i did n't know what i was really in for . my biggest concern was finding an extra bit of time , in my already too busy life , to write . well , so far so good . i have found the time to write , to read slices written by others , and to comment on at least three other posts written by others who have joined this challenge . i do n't know about you , but for me the story does n't always come easy . i call these dry days . these are the days when i ca n't seem to think of anything interesting enough to write about . every story that comes to mind , seems like a story i 've already told . sometimes , i attempt one or two story ideas , but abandon them for lack of inspiration or desire to write them .
the university of cincinnati track team took the stage to lead everyone in stretching , and everyone was supposed to be back with their group except our group had three coaches , a handful of running buddies , and no girls eventually they all made their way over to us right before the race started , and coaches started handing off girls to buddies . the smallest girl ended up with me . she was so cute , wearing pink butterfly wings , not quite chest high on me , and i bent down to introduce myself and give her a high five . she told me she was , so one of the youngest girls at the event in general it starts in third grade . the first thing she asked me was , do you run fast i laughed and told her i do n't run really fast but i enjoy running . i asked her how fast she runs and she said , super fast i told her i may have to keep up with her
you are so driven . that can be a blessing and a curse you set a goal and then work to pass it . you are super motivated . this is a huge blessing to me , but it is also something i worry about . you are so determined to to be your best , that the times you are not your best , you are so hard on yourself . much harder than your abba and i would ever be . i pray every single day that you would understand that our love , and god 's love , is not connected to how happy you make us or how disappointed we are . you were loved before you did a thing and you will be loved no matter what you do . i pray every single day , multiple times a day , that that truth will sink in . being so driven is a wonderful thing , but my hope is that you know that you are loved completely no matter what you accomplish .
well , what 's interesting is it sounds like you have great feedback from agents who just did n't know where they could take the book , or they did n't feel they had the contacts , or could do you justice because they felt the risk was too big , and , sometimes , agents do n't want to get an author 's hopes up when they know something is a long shot . what i 'd suggest is wait until you have the offer , and when you do , let the editor know that you 'd prefer to work with an agent so will need two weeks before you can get back to her . then i would immediately follow up with those agents you felt you got a good response from . those agents who sounded very interested in you and your work and , if they asked to see other things , clearly your voice . let them know you have an offer on that book and ask if they would consider offering representation .
i keep thinking at least we can use the waiting time to prepare for the baby s arrival . we have plenty of time on our hands to buy all the things we ll need , and read all those books on our list but then around christmas and new year , internet friends of ours almost almost had a baby placed with them . unfortunately , that placement was nt to be and they re back to waiting again , but they had less than a week s notice about the whole thing . we re so sorry they had to go through that , but it s made us realise more than ever that this could all happen for us at any time . and with very little notice . it s also driven home the fact that nothing s a given . not until the birth mom relinquishes her rights and actually becomes the birth mom , not just the mom . but that s a whole other post . which means we really should get ourselves ready .
so , here 's what i do on the first of each month , i send home one homework sheet for the entire month . on it is six activities the kiddos are to do at home . if they complete three of the activities during the month , they receive one point , if they complete more than three they receive two points , and if we meet our class homework point goal , the whole class gets a reward . i always have an alphabet based activity , one or more to do with our monthly unit theme , one where all they have to do is color a picture i attach , and the rest get changed up as i see fit . each item is on the easier side for my higher kiddos to ensure even my low kiddos can participate at all , but everyone will always need some assistance , even if it 's just reading the directions and recording their answers . an example from january is below if i can get the embedding to work
normally i am not interested in reality shows . i find they are a waste of time and usually promote values i have no interest in . yet i find that for the last seasons i have been drawn to the the biggest loser . i am certain that a great part of my interest has to do with the fact that i have struggled with my weight for many years . just years ago i decided it was time to do something about my enormous pound body . through prayer , diet , exercise i lost over pounds . over this last few years i have run several marathons as well as completed a full marathon last year . my road to recovery has not been easy but it has been a road that many face . hence my journey has made me more aware of those who struggle with their weight . just for fun i thought i would share some thoughts of the good bad i have found in the biggest loser tv show . let s start with the good .
it 's pretty simple , really . today , i felt like i was entitled to a few things a kind word , a thank you , some appreciation for having gone shopping and cleaned the cat box and played guitar hero and taken the family bowling . in truth , all of those things i have done today and probably hundreds more that i did not even know i did have likely been appreciated by my children in an authentic and deep way . that is usually how it works . the fact is that most days i am fine with being appreciated and respected in whatever ways work for my children , but today i would have preferred preferred to have been appreciated the way that felt best to me , regardless of how they felt about it . why well , frankly , because i feel like i am entitled to it not all the time , not even most of the time , and never when i am at my best and most secure just right here , right now .
i cleaned out my closet the other day . i pulled everything out to sort and threw countless pieces of clothing into a donation pile without thinking . then i came across a pair of maternity jeans that i only ever wore while i was pregnant with you . they were the first pair of maternity pants i bought , actually , and i loved them . they quickly became the most comfortable pair of jeans i had , and eventually the only ones i could still fit into . i wore them to the hospital . and then one day , after you were gone , i was wearing them out of habit maybe , or just because they were still the most comfortable jeans i had and i caught the back pocket on a nail on the deck and ripped a huge hole in them . into the closet they went , forgotten through my entire subsequent pregnancy and following year , until just the other day , when i pulled them out and just sat with them for awhile , remembering .
while the whole good versus evil story is good , and plays a major role in moving the story along , what i really want to talk about right now is flagg . flagg is , perhaps , my favorite of king s antagonists . reading the stand by itself , one might not necessarily understand just how much there is to flagg . yes he plays a big role in the story . yes he seems to have some sort of supernatural power . and yes , he hints at the fact that he has been around for a long time . but in the end , he does nt seem to amount to much . however , over the course of kings writing career , flagg pops up more than once . i wo nt go into that too much now , because that would be getting ahead of ourselves on this journey . i just wanted to mention that , despite what he may seem to be in the stand , he is much more than just a flash in the pan .
so with seeing this sunset , i thought i 'd write a poem about it . i did n't realise until the moment i finished it that it was prayer , the sensation i got writing it was just incredible what i wrote was so true , so simple , that it connected me to my lord . feeling that connection was something i have n't felt for a long time , the connection you get when he lets you know he has n't left you . the feeling i get when i 'm at summer school was the same feeling i got through this poem that ' high ' feeling where you are totally in awe and in love with the lord and you feel it back . i have to be honest , it 's not something i feel all the time . it 's not something you will feel all the time . faith is a blind thing most of the time , but god does confirm it to time to time . sort of saying do n't worry , i 'm still here , you 're doing great keep it up . '
i have to apologize that i have nt had the proper amount of time to write something new here . but i promise that i m going to make up for it . in just a few days , one of cityoftheweek s bucket list items is going to come true and i am fully prepared and can not wait to share the new experience . i decided that i would nt write of an old memory , but would like to share at first hand , the day after i come home , my new and probably wonderful opinions of a city i ve been dying to visit . in the next days i am going on a trip to a destination i ve long been waiting for , due to its reputation of being one of the most beautiful cities in its country . and as soon as i get back , the first thing i will do is to talk about it and it s surroundings , and of course show you some fresh pictures and some surprises . so please be a little bit more patient and tune in for some new updates very soon
some good news is that i have an interview for a job on friday . i had prayed about going back to work as littlest starts school in september . i had prayed that a job would come to me and that i would n't feel stressed about trying to find something . well , something did come to me . the deputy head of an independent christian school not too far from me had also been praying about a position needing filled and my name had dropped into his mind . i am certain that i am right for that job . it means also that my children will be able to attend it as well which is a bonus as fees are expensive . not as expensive as other private schools but still expensive to me so i have had to think about getting my teaching head in gear as i have n't used it properly in a good few years . saying that , i have been doing a little bit of tutoring this year so i am half way there already i guess . for those of you who do n't know , i am trained as a secondary english teacher . crafting has definitely taken a back seat this last month .
if you could trade places with anyone , living or dead , for one day ... who would it be most of us have probably heard that question at one time and have given it some thought . i never knew how to answer it until i had sam . now there 's no doubt in my mind that it would be my little year old daughter that i would trade places with . i know her better than anyone else does , but in many ways she 's a mystery to me . i would love to see how things work in her brain .... what she thinks , what she understands , what the world looks like through her eyes . i know that you never know exactly what the experience of another human being is , but with my older kids i feel like i have more to go on ... they react to the world similar to the way that i do , and they can tell me about their feelings and experiences . i feel that if i understood more about the ways in which sam 's brain works that i could be a much better parent to her .... i could understand more about what she needs and what would help her to learn .
it seems to me that many people are walking or should i say running around today in a state of tunnel vision , living life as others expect them to live it as opposed to living it the way they would choose if they had a choice . they get up in the morning , grab a very quick breakfast if you could call it that , and head off to work . many are probably eating their breakfast in the car so that they re not wasting any time . they get to work and the routine starts , either rushing from meeting to meeting or heads down in their cubicle , trying to complete everything that they can in the day , often not finishing until into the evening . and it has to be this way because everybody else in the office is doing the same thing , and thus the expectations are set . finally they re able to head home , hopefully in time to sit down to dinner with the family . but then their mind starts up again and they re already thinking about what they have to do in the morning or the next day . even though they re at home , they re not really there because their mind is someplace else . then the next day comes and it starts all over again .
for being only six , i remember it pretty clearly . i was in kindergarten , and it was some kid 's birthday , which was always a happy occasion because it meant the afternoon could be devoted to a little party if the kid 's parents felt like dropping by . in this case , they had brought cupcakes , more than enough for everyone . the condition for receiving cupcakes , as per my teacher 's requirements , was that we had to finish our after lunch work , in this case coloring a picture of mcgruff you know , take a bite out of crime , that mcgruff teaching us about fire safety . for most kids , this was an easy task , but i had a pure , unadulterated hatred for coloring . i would frequently get back papers on which i had gotten all the answers right but lost points for refusing to color an irrelevant drawing of a puppy , or whatever , at the top of , say , a math sheet . even being a small child , i knew this was unfair bullshit . so i was generally determined to color as little as possible , and that mcgruff thing was no exception . i knew the fire safety rules . why could n't i just answer questions about those why did i have to color
i guess i miss chris a little more than i expected to . although i 've kept busy and rarely have a spare moment to myself , at night i find myself thinking about him and it is hard . the morning i left phoenix he sounded as if he really was sad , and that he wanted to stay in touch , and he even told me he would try to visit this winter . now he is completely mean . he told me not to text him anymore , and that he will send me my stuff as soon as he can , and that he wants me out of his life . i have no idea where this harshness came from . i thought we were ending everything on good terms . it just was n't meant to be . however , i still wanted to remain friends , even if it is only once in a while , via text or whatever . i do n't get why he suddenly had a change of heart . it makes me sad because he was a part of my life , and i do love him . i did n't think we would just suddenly never talk or see each other again . the worst part is that he still has my bunnies , so i have to deal with his attitude until i can have them sent out here .
yes , i am late to the party . i am aware that earth day was last friday not today . i had the best of intentions to post this last friday but life got in the way . however i thought this was such a good thing that i am going to go ahead and share it with you now , even if it is late . what is it well by now i assume a lot of us are bringing our own reusable shopping bags with us to the grocery store , but what about all those plastic bags we use when buying our fruits and vegetables i know most people are still using the plastic bags provided at the grocery store and if you are anything like we are , they just get thrown away , they are n't good for anything else that i know of . i felt bad that it was such a waste so i got to thinking of a way to make a reusable produce bag and here is what i came up with . this idea is so simply and an idea that i am sure others have thought of so i am a little embarrassed to show it to you but if i thought it was cool and something very useful to help us cut down on waste , i am sure someone else will to so here you go , reusable produce bags .
the problem i 'm having i 'm not living the life i want anymore . i want more . when i got the job i have now and i 'm planning a post about that soon , my job and what i do it was meant to be hours a week , in an office . i went in on my first day and realized i could do the job from home , so a few months later , i was set up with a company computer and an office phone , and here i 've been , ever since , for three and a half years . my duties have changed , my hours have grown . for years , i struggled with not making enough money each month pay one bill one month , one bill the next , always trying to stay just ahead of the cut off ... i 'd get really far behind and ask friends for help . i managed my money poorly , on top of under earning . what a mess but for the last year or year and half , i 've kinda gotten it together . i pay my rent on time , and now , most other bills , too . i earn enough each month well , combined with child support to pay our bills , get groceries , etc . we 're not in a totally secure place , but much , much better than it 's ever been .
my grandfather passed away yesterday . and ironically today is his birthday . he would have been years old . man , was he a great guy after looking at tons of photos of him throughout the years , i realize what a blessing it has been to have had him as my grandpa . he sure did love his family , with all of his heart my family and i were praying for a miracle for when he passed away . i also prayed that this miracle would provide a peace that passed all understanding to my grandma , their kids , and our whole family , including my grandfather . god came through , and provided that miracle . although my grandfather was extremely week , had been sleeping all the time , his breathing was very very slow , and he had what was called the death rattle which is something i hate to even think about or say . he managed to form his hand into the ok symbol just before he passed away . my grandfather used to always make this sign with his hand , it was sort of his trade mark . my mom who was there through all of this , said that it must have taking him extreme effort to be able to do that . he had no more strength left . some how just before he had passed , he managed to let everyone know that he was going to be ok .
around a year a go i started begging god to show me his will , to show me what he wanted me to do . i begged him to please help me to step by step follow him . what i did n't realize at the time was that step by step is a lot harder . you see god does n't show you the steps ahead of time . it 's just one step and then you wait till he shows you the next one . a lot of times you are about to step where you think he wants you to and then suddenly there s a wall there and you ca n't get through . at first i feel sad and confused . god did n't you want us to go that way but then i thank god . have n't i been praying he would show us the way is n't putting walls up and closing doors a way of showing the way but what happens when more doors are closing then are opening does that mean we have n't found the right one or does it mean we were wrong all along i do n't know all the answers but i do know one thing and that is one step at a time we must walk by faith . we ca n't see what s ahead and most likely because it would scare us . when we say to god we want to stop living like americans and live like a sold out followers for you things really get scary
i am so ready for this new chapter of my life it s scary and fun all at the same time . while i have enjoyed the time that i have spent at the gas station and even more so the friends that i have made that will last a life time at least i hope . it s time for me to move on to a new place and make new friends and serve people in a different way . sure i will miss the people i worked with and the people who i was able to meet over the years that i was there , it is time for this change and time to meet these new people . i am also getting ready to take on a heavier load at school something that i have complete confidence in my ability to do after this semester . i have learned a lot about myself in the last few months . if i take the time and apply myself then i can make good grades , heck even great grades , as this semester shows , i have pretty much only a s . i also have learned that i love to learn , and i feel like it is something that makes the day better and i love to share the things that i have learned with other people . i have made some choices about things i want to do with my life and i have become a stronger person . i am ready for this new time in my life and i am ready to show the world just what this girl is made of .
my boyfriend . i really hope he does n't mind me talking about him but he has become a big part of my life . he did n't just pop up out of nowhere . he was always there . we went to middle school and high school together . we never really hung out with the same crowd but it seems as though god put him on this earth for me , to be there for me when i needed him . i had been sick for almost years when he showed back up into my life . i was just in the middle of trying to be ok with the fact that it would be hard for me to find someone that was going to be ok with what i had been through and was still going through . and then there he was , totally ok with it , willing to be there for me through absolutely anything . now , you can not tell me that he was n't heaven sent . i was watching the movie a walk to remember the other night and it 's about a girl who falls in love with someone totally unexpected but is also battling leukemia . even though i have seen this movie numerous times , i had not seen it since i have been with my boyfriend . the story hit very , very close to home . she mentions at one point in the movie that maybe god had given her a plan much bigger that she could imagine . that maybe he sent the person she fell in love with to help her through a difficult time . to be her angel . well , my boyfriend is my angel .
it is not because valentines day is fast approaching and i am single because i do not care about it one bit . no today i was taking a break from working and decided to relax , but the wicked can never rest , because as soon as i tried , the phone rings with a friend on the other line needing some emotional support after a break up . i am there to help the friends who have broken down , the friends struggling , those whose relationships have failed it s all in a days work , but at the same time it is sort of draining , something which sucks the life out of you . no one likes being dumped nor breaking up with their lover , but sometimes in life there are obstacles and difference in views that sometimes it can not be helped . but i do nt feel like i can be a friend anymore . they say a true friend sticks around through the good , bad and the rough , but somehow i seem to carry a lot of friends who only go through the rough and never really through the happy times . i am not saying that all my friends are draining this feels terrible saying but it is the truth that i need to face . i am tired of always trying to fight a losing battle . i should not give up i know , but it is so hard yet so easy to just throw in the towel . friendships should nt have to be this difficult and some of my other friendships are nt but most of my friendships nowadays i view as a burden i obviously have let them become too dependent on me and sometimes it is important to say no .
i do nt know about other women , but i would nt want to date a man exclusively if he already knew he did nt want me as a wife or as a live in partner heck , if he still had doubts after one year peace i would say , okay , fine . yes , i like love you let s continue to date . but i reserve the right to date other men if i choose to do that , and you are free to do the same . i just ask that if you start sleeping with someone else , please let me know . that way , there s less of a chance for hurt feelings sometimes that just ca nt be helped , and everyone is on the same page . it s honest . and , when you re really not sure where you are , it s always best to just come clean and be honest . i mean , it might not be her , right maybe you want to live in russia when you retire , and she just wants to go to alabama . that would nt work . maybe you thought she was the one at first and now you re like , no , i did nt realize she was . and that does nt have to be a negative thing it could be that she s so into you that she neglects her own life and centers her social life around your life and based on what you re doing or what you two will do and not do together . some men love women who adjust their lives like that.but i also know some men who would hate it . maybe she fits the ideal woman you want she gets a check next to every thing on your list , but you just are nt into her like that . you do nt have to tell her why if it s going to hurt her feelings , but i think she deserves to know that you do nt see her that way or that you re still not sure .
