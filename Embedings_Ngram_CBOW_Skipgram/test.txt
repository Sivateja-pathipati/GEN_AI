thank you for letting me share my rd with you i hope you enjoyed reading about all the details of our big night before the big day i truly am so thankful for such a perfect evening spent with all my favorite people .
the first time we did it was in and we made . gradually over the years word has got around and lots of the surrounding small businesses and residents look forward to our cakes arriving . we know this because they tell us so
i think my teacher is one of the best i ever had . she is really understanding and always remembering us students about that we are studying cause it s fun and cause we want to . there is no must just wanting .
we talked about how to be generous with one another . about not turning every tiny frustrating event into world war . about how there s never a good reason to haul of and punch your brother in the face especially over the bible
if i do n't get to post again before christmas , happy christmas , everyone . may god be with you and your families during this special time of the year . and take some great pictures of all the fun things you do
really hope it 's going to be fine when she gets up but considering she has refused to move her arm since pm and even in her sleep is not moving it i have a feeling we will be taking a trip to er
i need all of your advice i recently fell in love with a new rug for our dining room , but need all of your expert opinions with the pattern we already have on the wall , is this too much in the space
well , despite what i said a few weeks back , i 'm posting something here , but when you finish reading this , you 'll understand why i have broken the fast . a few details of the last few weeks first .
did she really just say what i think she said i wondered , but decided that since it was late and she really needed to go to sleep , i would not pursue such a deep conversation right then . i remained silent .
i slowly walked over to the bar cart and poured myself a copper delight . i raised an empty glass in her direction , asking if she wanted one herself . she shook her head . that was the extent of our communication .
but , now that i finally get it , i can sit here having turned my worries over to god , with thanksgiving enjoying the view of the moment , while i watch , hope , wait and most importantly trust in god .

this sister and brother in law would both give their shirt off their back to help someone else in a time of need . it is only right to do our part to give back , even if it 's just a little .
the part of the course which was my favourite was that jennifer showed us how to do a rose cupcake . although mine is far from perfect and will require lots more practice , i am still pleased at how it turned out .
but mostly it was the fact that some one that i adore and who knows my body s sexual responses as well as her own , was totally into what she was doing to me and i was totally into having it done .
thru this same lady s reading came the most incredible exercise for her to do . she is very left brain dominant and may demands use of her right brain and to allow the left brain to function as it was designed to .
you re doing a great job . you re the best dad in the world . i m sorry the moms at story time wo nt let you into their circle , but i do nt want you talking to other women anyway .
i listened to this one a couple of times and absolutely loved it most of all because it reminds me of someone i know . in fact , when i played it to my regular practice partner he thought of the same person .

you want to leave your work and do something you love do it . regardless of what happens you will have tried , and if your doing something you love you will work twice as hard to be able to keep doing it .
there 's sort of a fourth , which is that you have sent a good book to someone who just does n't like it . that 's bad luck and there is nothing you can do about editors ' or readers ' tastes .
i think i ll call him this week and we ll see what happens . i m sure he s not expecting me to ring but that s why it ll be funny and that s why i m going to do it .
the bible was the catholic church s idea an idea that was inspired and guided by the holy spirit . the bible was not absolutely essential to the church , since the church did just fine without a bible , for some years .
this is obviously dependent on actually knowing the letters first be sure to build up to letter sounds once your child can identify each letter . this is a crucial skill as your child learns to read and must sound out a word .
it 's similar to hosting the radio show , because in both instances i get to live a fantasy life for a brief time before checking back in with the real world . it 's an escape , but a healthy one usually .
hello people this is my first post in , i hope you had a nice celebration , made or not some new year resolutions to yourself and are happy to start a new year , new opportunity to try something new and improve yourself
i am still happy to have one less thing to worry about . being able to do things without being in pain is a good thing . if only the rest of my troubles could be fixed i d be in great shape .
i thought i d share this with you today as d went into school well , had a settled day according to her diary , came out well and we had a nice evening i think the fact it was nt raining helped .
i am sorry to hear you have problems . but i can assure you that there will probably be a day when you either do not have problems or your problems are so minute that you do nt really much care about them .
and i surprise myself by liking this . going from rare to maybe medium cooked . i find out she s in australia , she has greek roots , she s a teenager i think . and two overwhelming feelings come over me .

i am sure there are more that are less than . , but i 'm ca n't seem to remember any more . if you know of more that are below . that will be available on april th please leave a note .
well , that 's some of the fun stuff i 've been up to i 'll be posting recipes for lots of these later on . now , i 'm off for a fun evening with the girls , plus tomorrow is the craft fair
preheat your oven to and place large size eggs in a mini muffin pan large end down . if you do n't have a mini muffin pan , you can use a regular cupcake pan they they will just roll around a little more .
. if you have a loved one , you can spend time with them without worrying about taking the children to all their activities . you do nt have to help anyone with homework either , or put up with the public school system .
step one adjust your eyes and ears . look at your child as a person , just like you , only with different ways of expressing needs . look at your child 's actions as expressing needs . listen and respond to those needs .
s flew more than , miles to attend the event . another canadian , she was sweet and shy , but very intelligent and lots of fun . i was very lucky to be able to play with s several times during the weekend .
anyway , the paint and medium together worked like a charm . i have a few more to go and it is so much fun . my daughter thinks it is great also . she always wants to help with everything . love her .
wedding card . the brown is from my dining room table . after making this card i still have yet to make the wedding shower card . well , i 'd better get busy , but the following is how i did this card .
it did n't take long to see he was serious about it as opposed to , say , cleaning his room or doing laundry , so it was time to shop for a quality horn he 'd have and use for years to come .
do n't quote the book in the query letter . at this point you 've told me nothing about the plot . you 've used up of your words and you 've not answered the main question of a query what is the book about
so that 's a little look into how we try to make our house a home . to me , it 's all about surrounding yourself with beautiful things that hold meaning . if you do that , you really ca n't go wrong .
for the first time , luxury brands , and when i say that i mean luxury in quite a loose sense of the word , are approaching their marketing in the knowledge , finally , that the digital world can no longer be ignored .
the sun is shining and my basic skin care routine seems to be working great still so today i am foundation free . in fact for the last week or so i have not worn foundation most days and enjoying the fresh faced feel .
our families were there even though most of mine had the line drawn . i already had my mom in the mess of it all and she was going through her own issues with it all . i hated putting so much on her .
she got tired of standing in her bed so she sat down and then decided she really was tired . it looked pretty uncomfortable so we helped her lay flat but i 'm sure she would have just stayed that way for a while .
but this was always about the journey , rather than the destination . and it was a challenging , magical trip . fortune smiled on us all the way . and a lot of very kind people gave us help , advice and encouragement .
do n't forget , it does n't have to be a card , it can be a scrap page or any other crafty creation as long as it 's got buttons on it maybe you could even have a go at making your own buttons
i am about to have my sister , barbara , for a few days . we are going to make cards while she is here . thank goodness i will have her to push me apparently i need someone to do that right now .
if you have any animal homes , tools , materials or building plans that we can explore in the classroom , please send them to school . please label them so that we can return them to you at the end of the month .
if your out in the stores this weekend pick up a few supplies and stash them in a secure location in your home . if you have kids you know what i mean about a secure location hide the supplies or they 'll disappear .
one of those projects is our dining room turned library that i first told you about in january . my plan was to get rid of the never used dining room and turn it into cozy library type space that we would actually use .
she had a great time with the swim , failed to get eaten by a shark , and they raised money . as mentioned in the original posting , she came in only at the last minute to fill a gap in the team .
it 's to be expected , i guess . we 'd bought it when they first came out , and we use it all the time every day for hours . so for it to be acting up now is really not a surprise .
hello , everyone i hope you all had wonderful weekends we have been busy here shipping lots of goodies out . it is so fun to see the stamps and paper going out the door because that means we get to see your creations soon
visit someone much older than you , such as someone in a nursing home , on your birthday . if you are already in a nursing home , then go visit a funeral home . this should have the same effect for your situation .
i took a philosophy class , and there was a discussion that intrigued me . i do nt remember what exactly that lesson was . all i remember was that there was something about birth . i thought what if the world was nt born
she said nothing , but reached out her hand to him . then he gave her a kiss and led her outside , lifted her onto his horse , and took her to the royal palace where their wedding was celebrated with great joy .
if anyone wishes to come after me , he must deny himself , and take up his cross and follow me . for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it . matthew
here 's the thing . i like to fit a lot into my life . i like to take advantage of the opportunities i have to meet people , go places , experience things . i think that 's a healthy approach to life .
but it 's this portrait that keeps drawing me back . it 's always so interesting to me to see what children see when they look at people on a daily basis . what is it that they remember and that sticks out to them
in case there is anyone wondering where we have been for the last four months , let me update you . from the last post you might assume we have been busy getting our new venture off the ground . . . but no .
i choose to see them , to look into the face of the devil . i do nt know if what i do actually makes a big difference or any difference at all , but i ll be damned if i ever stop trying .
i always hate to see a query writer put their age in a query . i particularly hate it when the query writer is young . nothing good comes of this . agents are n't looking for young they 're looking for good projects .
ca nt we all just get along , people do nt you see that we are all correct that there is no right and wrong we re in this together and if we do nt stick together then where the hell does that leave us
this is prince s first album . at age , he wrote , composed and produced the whole damned thing . he even played all the instruments . all at the age of . that alone is why for you is a must have .
he tries to set the picture back on the shelf , but it keeps falling over . so , we discuss the stand on the back of the picture frame and why it needs to be out to keep the picture from falling over .
lets just say some nasty events happen that are beyond the girls control . a fight breaks out and several people are wounded and dying . these would be the turning point where one of the ladies gets out and fights her way through .
aunt amanda is getting old yesterday she turned years old , and i m only months old . i ca nt imagine someone living that long , and you know what my mom is even older than amanda she better not die before me .
i will attempt to read books again . you may find it a challenge to read in the year . that 's okay . challenge yourself . you decide your limit . set the goal and lets all join together to help you accomplish it
maybe our biggest fear of all is being abandoned and rejected . and if you add that fear with the threat of losing your entire existence , everything that you are used to , i venture to say that most people become very scared .
if you were unaware of world zombie day i consider it my duty , not only as a halloween and zombie lover but also as a cheesy zombie movie lover , to inform you . you may find additional information on world zombie day here
how true is that statement . i m living through that right now . actually , i live with that everyday . and it s a constant struggle finding that in between , where logic and emotions meet and dreams and reality co exist .
is n't it fascinating that i needed to remind myself who i was making the album for there was no external pressure about this . i sure seem to fight a lot of internal pressure . where does it come from and why so strongly
no matter what . keep writing during the exercise . obviously not if the house is on fire . and keep going day after day . and really , really , really make sure you get back on the horse if you fall off .
and now , friends , you 'll never guess what . as those of you who 've been there know , pregnancy takes nine months . you ca n't rush it , and in the meantime , you still have to leave the house .
then i found a way to get in through the back door to post this post but as soon as you hit preview that 's it there is no way to go back and actually post that post your locked into that preview page .
trip to australia literally every single person i graduated high school with went to australia at some point over the last ten years . i do nt know what drew them there , other than the fact that it s just upside down canada .
it s little things like that really . i know that a year from now i ll be settled and have everything i could have ever dreamed of . there are good investment opportunities on the horizon , and lots of money to be made .
am i working any less hard than usual nope . am i trying to perform poorly certainly not . is there an obvious reason why my performance is nt quite up to the standard i want it to be not that i can think of .
i was talking with a really good guy friend of mine over the weekend . we had nt spoken in awhile so we were catching up on the latest news in our lives , and he mentioned his girlfriend . here s how the conversation went
speaking of which , that is this coming weekend how can it be easter already i guess i am just in denial that it is even spring , because the weather in seattle still feels like winter , and it is gross . i need sunshine
i hate to admit it , but i did nt buy much . i am terrible at making snap decisions , so i tend to make no decisions at all the things i thought i could nt live without were always in other people s arms
in my s i was having babies so while i know i wore makeup , i sure do n't remember putting it on . i barely remember what i was wearing , what i was thinking , or what i was saying during my s .
i do nt know why these men keep showing up . maybe it s to remind me of the things i wo nt put up with anymore . maybe it s to show me how good certain other people are . i m not sure .
finally , for those of you that wish to go that extra mile , the next time you go to the bathroom , look at yourself in the mirror and either out loud or to yourself , say these words , three times in a row
these are consistently even burning , and good . i never have to worry about how it is going to burn and what flavors i am going to be surprised by . always an even oak and leather flavor with just a dash of pepper .
all in all , it was a great night . there was a live band , to which the two peas danced their hearts out on the dance floor , and a photo booth where they got some awesome photos to document this fun occasion .
i have to remind myself how fortunate i am to live so close to a wonderful spot like this and make time to take advantage of it more often . of course once the longer days of summer arrive it ll be a lot easier .
in some ways it is the best of both worlds . i get to decide the flavour of the stories i want , the topic and the style . but i also get to read great stories sent to me from all over the world .
we have also done some shape matching . i use pattern blocks and let them explore the shapes . then i sing a little song and see if they can match my shape they do a great job of finding the correct shape for the song
i got a big compliment from my principal . she emailed a picture of my word wall out to the entire staff . it is nice to know that i am doing things right and that she feels they are worthy of sharing with others .
i know that all of you readers out there are terribly responsible with your money . you have savings accounts and have months of salary in reserve for a rainy day and you are responsible with your credit cards and lose sleep over interest rates .
tuesday may st my sister and i set up for a birthday dinner date night after i got off work . we knew we would n't get to hang out for my actual birthday so we made plans early and i loved every minute of it
at this point i was wishing i knew how to use the video on my camera , the birds were singing away and were wonderful to listen to . please use your imagination when looking at the photos below and listen to the bird song .
after a few days i thought wow , this is hard in a good way and everyone is awesome maybe i could stick with this for a while after all since there s a good chance it will lead to the opportunity i really want .
i thank you , god , that you have promised that when i call upon you , you will listen to me . so , lord , i pray that you will begin this very day to set that hope and that future in motion .

a friend of mine 's cat was run over yesterday and i 'd be lying if i said i did n't fight the tears when i heard . i 've been sad ever since and keep thinking of her beautiful cat and my beautiful friend .
turned out , for the most part the perspective stayed fairly similar . i guess because i was looking across from the train all the time . but it was good to know i could have gone wild with the perspective had i wanted to o
i found this fabric a couple of years ago and knew right off the bat that it must come home with me i bought yards thinking that should be enough , it took nearly years to finally get brave enough to make the st cut .
as i have said before i add my pasta to the pan that has the sauce so that the last bit of cooking time is in the sauce . it allows the sauce to incorporate into the pasta itself making for a much more delicious result
i think four finished novels is a good goal to shoot for . it 'd be great to post a year from now and say that i had achieved that goal , plus the musical projects . hell , it 'd be a great year .
then how would my decisions get made , you ask because you ca nt just do nothing . although , doing nothing would technically be a decision also , would nt it i d be deciding to do nothing . i just ca nt win .
it seems to me that it s the little things that make a friendship . let me tell you about some of my memories of you and us . from the smallest to the most prominent , i have lots of important memories about our friendship
but for now , my sweet love has asked me to turn my adventures into dreams for tomorrow and more and head off to bed . and so , it s sweet dreams and a good night to everyone , that is until tomorrow . haha
after a long pause , he says , watching me carefully , no dad , but i would like to cook modern australian food with an indian touch , and he leaves it there but then adds quietly , if i ever become a chef .
all in all , an amazing meal that inspired us with its creativity on all levels creativity backed by taste and talent both in the kitchen and out . no wonder the private kitchen became fairly public knowledge and objects of desire pretty much instantly .
i 'm going to stop now and focus on getting in more water . that will help too and i 'm getting all kinds of exercise from running to the bathroom every minutes or so . i must be losing a lot of water today .
. to encourage you if you are having one of those mommy days where you feel like a failure , come by and be reminded that we all have those days , and god gives us grace to face them and strength to get through them
i only want to help you to remember this tragedy among so many more . i hope that we , on the outside , can never forget what normal people like all of us had to deal with , and deal with all the time .
i would never survive in the hunger games . especially if i had to fake a relationship for the audience at home . i ca nt even do it when it s real . so the odds would not be in my favor . ever .
it got me thinking about stuff . me . us . it was such a reflection as to why , we in the american church , really have no patience for each other or for god 's way of doing things . like , seriously .
sometimes i find myself wanting to freeze time , or capture it inside a bottle so i can remember certain moments forever . i know i 'm not alone in this , but i have yet to figure out how to do it any help here
well , he said , pulling himself up beside me on the pillow , i have a feeling you are a woman who can manage more than just once a night , and now that we have established the basics , how about pushing the boundaries
this is the first year i was able to spend the th of july with my brother , rich , in six years . he served in the army and completed a tour in afghanistan and came back last year after four years of service .
if i have to do without live shows for a while , it 's nice to see the sweet little baby behind it . i get it . i 've got kids . however , i 'm still holding out for a new cd in .
even though this is a digital plan , i love the small bench with the rock at foot near the upper left corner . we 'll add a bench at one of the fence lines , in direct site of the grass and the entire backyard
there are occasions when you do n't have a lot of time to make a card , more and more often in my case at the moment and need to be able to put something together quickly and this design would fit the bill perfectly .
hey white boy i heard while crossing the street . i quickly realized that , since i am white , a man , and the only other the person on the street , they were probably talking to me . so , i turned around .
i do nt care how you find one . just make sure it happens . offer whatever you have to . no price is too steep . he laughed to himself that he d not be out the expense anyway . edward would cover it .
q you are an ex pat . how has that had an influence on your writing or has it how do you balance writing and being a wife and mother what 's your schedule like how do you keep your writing time sacred or do you
to be honest , most of the meeting went way over my head . i think you need to have at least one party under your belt to understand most of what was said , but it was still enjoyable . i also won a candle
my son , the father said , you are always with me , and everything i have is yours . but we had to celebrate and be glad , because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found .
luckily , i did nt have to go into work until am . those are some nice hours right there , eh going in for am , leaving shortly before . you wo nt hear me complain , especially because i get paid for hours anyway .
pray god thank you for the love you give to me . that patience and kind love even when i do nt deserve it . you freely give it to me . help me today show others to love by being patient and kind today amen .
my teen heroes were all in adult books when i was a teen myself but now that i read and review a lot of young adult ya fiction and write it too , i have developed a sophisticated taste in hot young men all over again ,
women the church s most wasted resource but for many women particularly wives and mothers , leaving does nt mean walking away more often it means showing up without being present . women often do this because they want their husbands and children to grow spiritually .
i was in awe of this little sewing machine . it worked by turning the handle and of course on does single stitch . i am not sure i am devoted enough to sew much when each turn of the handle would make just one stitch .
yesterday was the first day back into running since the london marathon , an easy . miles around a park near chris house . he also came along and we decided to head in different directions , meet in the middle and then at the end .
we are also working to prepare ourselves through reading of other books as well . reading the life 's experiences of others helps so much in knowing how to handle life ourselves . we are blessed to be able to have so many good things to read
let me say one more thing to you parents , you parents can not be a star if you are in sin you can not be covered in sin and shine and if the parents are not a star , how can the children be a star
think . let s all think how often do we say i love you allah maybe as often as times a day but let s all do nt just use lip service . let s all say it and mean it and proof it by actions .
it s like trying to play all the instruments in a band at once . not many individuals can master all at once , but if you focus and practice on one before moving to the next , you would then be decent at many instruments .
it is much easier for me to accept difficult things when i do n't start thinking , what did i do wrong to deserve this and instead think , this is temporary . with god 's help , i will learn from this and become stronger .
do nt worry god told me has been telling me since wednesday , or probably before that . i am all you need he s right , of course . as usual . i think he thought it was time to get it through my head .
republicans gave me this list the beginning of this year as a priority , something that they thought they could do . now i m ready to do it , and so far we have nt gotten the kind of movement that i would have expected .
she said it has been causing a lot of concern , not just to the government but also to an awful lot of members of the public . by the summer we will have in place new immigration rules which i believe will end that abuse .
we do nt care whether mainstream media covers this or people see us on television . what counts are the more than , viewers following our online live stream , he said . we heard from a lot of them , and they re joining us now
yay nearly the weekend again , had a really busy week so have not been able to catch up with you all yet , hopefully i will get a chance later tonight . hope you have had good week , not got too wet or blown away
well , it s possible that s the case except perhaps for the bit about the end of the world , but if so the editor should be telling you about it . if she is nt , the difficulties are probably internal to the publisher .
men . that s what you will become this year . each one of you will pit yourself against the wild of the forest . those of you that survive will come back men , and be assigned a post based of how well you did .
there was a lot of restrictions , no gas or oil was the largest issue , since i had planned to ride the bike to where it needed to go . no problem , was the reply , we will come and pick it up . really
but then , saving grace my friend karen who , by the way , the bride does n't know in real life , and who had no logical reason to be at her dream wedding showed up . karen happened to be wearing exactly the correct earrings
we just need to concentrate , keep calm , keep everyone on the pitch , hope brad jones is ok and , above all , stick the bleeding ball in the net when we get the chance hope springs eternal so i ll say to us .
i decided to be a teacher because all professionals come from a teacher . you can think of a lawyer , a doctor they all pass through teachers . i wanted to become someone who is giving people knowledge and making an impact in their lives .
i wanted to give each of you a little something as a thank you for everything you 've given me this year . well , it did n't arrive in time for christmas . we 're all moms here , so i know you 'll understand .
i guess it s a matter of confidence . at least i know that this is just a passing phase . the first time you meet this , it can be devastating . if you re facing that right now , have faith it will pass .
well now that halloween has passed you know what that means , thanksgiving barely gets a mention and we are straight on to christmas . so that means i better get started now or i will be so behind i will never be ready in time .
but if that 's the case , that just completely proves how alone we really are in the world , and how our lives are shaped by the decisions that we make for ourselves . and that is why we will forever be at step one .
i love homemade cards with lace and glitter , i think telling someone what they mean to you should n't be reserved for one day . i love when my husband will just start dancing with me in the kitchen when there is no music on .
how to win on april st , i ll post a list of links to all the entries , along with a reader poll . i will leave this poll up for a week and then it will be closed at some point on april th .
what do you think will happen if a white man simply walks up to a black woman shoots her at point blank range and kills her would they call him a racist would the media have it as main news as a sign of a racist killing
once you practice these techniques and get the hang of them , you 'll be able to hit the trails feeling comfortable on your mountain bike . even though it may take some getting used to , it 'll become second nature before you know it .
if you 're anything at all like me , you have a stack of fabric scraps from projects past . beautiful , wonderful , colorful fabrics that make you feel happy and full just looking at them . come on , now . i know you do
i feel pretty bad about it . when the kids were young , we used to take them every th of july . we brought a cooler and lawn chairs and junk food and we sat in the back of our pick up truck to watch .
so , the bottom line is that i really enjoyed it . i loved the interaction with the class and the flow of questions , of which some i could nt answer there and then but i took notes and got the answers to everyone within hours .
another semester of journey groups is coming to a close . this time around has been especially sweet for me . i have deeply enjoyed connecting with women in my own church body and i am beginning to see the start of some new , deep friendships .
there are many ways to get noticed in publishing . but in truth , the best thing you can do is give your book a fighting chance by getting a professional eye on it before it is seen by anyone who has the power to reject it .
and while he was on the diet , i used to make stir fry for dinner once a week , which he always looked forward to . so today i decided to share this excellent stir fry recipe with you . just look at all those colorful vegetables
keith and susan joined us around noon . i knew we would have a have a wonderful time with them , as we always do . the wine cracked open by and we spent the afternoon on the deck enjoying the most wonderful weather you could imagine .
that was february ' , i was determined that i was going to see this fight forward . i felt that if i was nt going to fight this fight that fell into my lap , he said , there was no other fight he could wage .

today we opened the last few presents , including a cars sleeping bag from grandma and grandpa . he insisted on sleeping in it on our floor tonight . i just checked on him and he is asleep on the floor , but not in the sleeping bag .
this is not the only time he 's done this . he tried to explain to me the other day why it was more logical for me to keep my shower soap outside the shower . this went on for minutes . he 's one of those guys .

first time for the last few days that i 've had any i 've been so busy with pre teens being extremely demanding , a sick baby and trying to get some time with the hubby that i nearly forgot what it was like to get mins silence .
in terms of finding albums the trend seems to towards showing ever larger photos of the album covers , which is nice to look at , but if you re looking at an artist with lots of albums , it makes it hard to find a particular one .
i wonder if some people cry and protest a lot because it is the only language they know . i wonder if we need to teach people how to gain new ways of expressing themselves . i wonder if we need to speak more kind words to them .
that 's how i feel right now . sometimes i just have to quiet down , let go and trust . surrender and go with the flow , knowing that even if i ca n't see the bigger picture , i am going where i am meant to .
from what i have been told by a friend , the movie stays pretty close to the books . so , if you like the books , by all means go see the movie . if you have nt , i think there are better movies out there .

i completed the layout with the fun and colorful banner stickers from the field notes sticker sheet . my layout was very colorful so i used a great black and white photo of my niece . i love the contrast between bright colors and black and white photos .

i 'm sorry that i drank half the atlantic ocean . i 'm sorry that there is now fewer pounds of sand on the shore . you drove two hours just to go to a dog beach so that i could come and that was how i thanked you
as a potential employer looks at how you are dressed , how you hold your head , how you walk in , what confidence you show , if you look at them directly in the eyes and do you speak with a firm tone the interview has begun .
i think you have to base the answer to your question on what you know about your grandmother . is she living solely on social security and is a lot for her or do you think she s just not aware that the wedding dress you want costs more
personally i 'm not the biggest fan of long drives , so i end up usually sleeping a lot in the van . obviously getting to see our friends and play shows is the good part , the down time in between can be a bit rough sometimes .
the room was more silent this day than any other . even though we were in the boys ' room , with the special mothers , and all the other children that slept in that room . there was no crying , or talking . no loud movements .
in its absence take a look at this interesting picture and make something up for yourself . i 'm going to give it a try while me and my horse are out doing our thing if the story comes together well i might post it here sometime soon .
did i mention that i work full time i also do a fair bit of stuff outside if that too in fact i generally have a pretty packed life . my husband does too . the dog , on the other hand , is a right lazy devil .
i was born on may th . i have a brother who s seven years older than me . although the age difference is really big but it is nt hard to connect with him . ever since we were children , we did everything together including shopping .
it was like looking for a part time job . as a teenager . hoping to land something that would nt pay too badly . that would help me save up a few dollars over the summer months . anyway , that s how i looked at it .

and one of the things that i learned with my kids was that when food was grown fresh , if you got it from your garden or from a farmer s market or from a fresh produce section , it tastes better . so it tastes pretty good .
if we could only see how the things that make us great so easily destroy us . our minds are wonderful in creation and the king james bible is designed to fit them . or we could say that our minds are designed to fit the king james bible
still , i set up an appointment for today with a therapist i had worked with in the past . i realized that the next time i spoke with my friend , i did nt want to lay my stuff on him as he had done with me .
so what s the problem it s a leadership challenge boys and girls . that s all it is . it happens in political parties . let it happen , argue your case , put it to the members in a fair contest and then accept the outcome .
the amazing thing about grace is that we should be eager to give it away , anxious to demonstrate it every chance we can . it should be first nature to us . we should not even need to be asked to forgive . it should be obvious .
the only problem is that it is nt a long enough album , at least not when i have a whole house of rooms that need some serious attention . next on the shopping list might have to be some more turn it up to eleven albums i think .
i was so happy that i got to work with them for a mother 's day mini session . both of these little girls are amazing they put a smile on my face whenever i 'm around them . and mama is a gorgeous lady herself inside and out .
but the other point is that anti whites have never let a little thing like reality get in the way of their sick agenda . they say they are anti racist . what they really are is anti white . anti racist is just a code word for anti white

you can print this out and mail it to friends who do n't have email to join the session . you can also read this to people over the phone if they do n't have email and they 'll get the energy when they use their intention to join .
my daughter left her middle school party early to go back to her elementary school to say goodbye to all her former teachers and be at her brother 's party sweet girl . matthew loved his teacher this year she is so fab and we will miss her so much
but not matter which school i choose both are fairly close to home so that s good . no more than a hour drive from either of the schools . speaking of driving i was thinking about my first car not sure what i am going to choose yet .
i feel like a child , seeing things for the first time with a brand new set of eyes . i realize now that i could not be forced to enter a beautiful world . i had to see it for myself . i wonder how could i show you
please share whatever you see with me , i m interested to know what others do or , perhaps do nt , as some have said , i ca nt see anything , or it just looks like the flash was too bright , that s all i see .
we are a family that loves to travel but we also love to come home again . there 's nothing like sleeping in your own bed , eating in your own kitchen and knowing that the hair you find in the shower is from your own head . amen .
while it is fantastic that business development is gaining more momentum throughout the industry , it should be noted that business development is not for everyone this does not mean that all credit unions do nt need it this means that the business development profession is not for everyone .

they re old enough now where they re simply curious . they re not actually confusing the videos with reality meaning they do nt really think the trees are out to get them . but they do love their questions , and i just do nt have the energy .
to date , i 've written short stories and i have more that i really want to get completed . i 've learned a few things during this process . for example , i ca n't write humor . my hat is off to those of you who can .
water and snacks . john actually brings water for those having lessons , but if you re heading off on your own having something to sip on , and snack on keeps the energy up . after your adventure settle down and have a picnic right in the park .
we hope that you have been enjoying the holidays so far . there is nothing better than sharing your time with the friends and family that make life great . let 's not forget all of the delicious food though . it makes for an awesome couple of months .
no matter how loud i yell or how mad you are at me , we still love each other . you may only be months old today but when you 're and sneak out of the house or get your first f in school , i still love you .
i have a lot happening in my life right now . so much that i 'm struggling to handle it all . but i will . i 'll get through it and come out the other end . and so , i have no doubt , will my friends .
now , my dear mothers , knowing of your divine role to bear and rear children and bring them back to him , how will you accomplish this in the lord s way i say the lord s way , because it is different from the world s way .
while i was there , i picked up my painting . this is an early birthday present from my mom with a little help from me . they are so great there , they have lay a way . i think everyone should have something beautiful in their house .
it breaks my heart to know that he does nt feel special . so i told him a story about the first little baby that was in my belly , and how much i love him and how special he was from the very first moment i held him .
i do n't want to be married to the person whom i was married to for years fun fact th anniversary happened days before the divorce was final . i do n't want her back , ever . she did awful things to me things i ca n't forget .
once i was trying to show my visiting sister , who was in town for work , around the city , and she kept complaining about being unable to find anything because i never went the same way twice . i did n't even realize i 'd been doing that
i did . and i really tried to be normal i did all the things i thought you were supposed to do , and still i felt out of place and unhappy . how do all the people around me manage this , i thought what am i doing wrong
all in all the night was a blast and i hope we will get to see more free hills nights . they really do owe it to the loyal customers who are always willing to pay even when there are more than lined up event all in one weekend .
at what point on this scale does the god give man the soul we have no way really of knowing , self awareness certainly becomes a factor early on in the scale , does that mean the soul is entered there at what point then are we god 's design
i might not be a super model , i might not be your age anymore , i might not be rich but what i earned i did get with hard work , i m honest and the man on my side loves me for how and who i am .
i built my pr practice telling clients that they must tell the truth . the worst kind of pr person is the one who is so eager to spin the story they forget that telling lies always , always , always comes back to bite them and their client .
i have dreams about killing myself . i have dreams about dying . i have dreams about running away and not being here anymore . i have dreams about being surrounded by people i ca nt see or communicate with . i just ca nt ever connect with them .
i would love to hear from other moms who have been through this , as i actually feel a little in denial that i will really be back in that routine again . it 's almost like i feel i just have to do one day and that 's it .
i will continue to question , to do my best to live with honour . to those around , to my lord and lady , family and friends . to all of you who read my words . to those unknown , but who still form part of my life .
i thought carefully about his question , and then i replied , it s not one thing , it s two gratitude and letting go . gratitude for everything , not just the things we consider good or a blessing . and letting go of everything we ca nt change .
i did n't think i 'd be posting again this weekend , but yesterday i remembered that i have a grandma and aunt . so obviously i should have something for them for mother 's day . i was feeling creative , so these are what i came up with .

but as i designed , the houses started getting bigger . more and more things became essential . i would need a place to brew beer . i would want a studio to paint and write . somewhere to sleep , and yes , somewhere to eat might be nice .
sometimes i wish i could go back in time and re do most of my life . mainly because i have done lots of stupid things over the years but also to take more notice of the people around me and be a friend to those who i have forgotten .

after one of my classes i had two participants , who had both worked extremely hard in the class , come and see me . i knew their faces well but did n't realise that it had been so long since i had seen them both time flies as they say
during the meal he repeatedly made himself known and not in a good way . the type of person who asks for things when they 're already on their way . looking for problems and all the while feeling important because he knows your job much better than you do .
here is the issue with that way of thinking . our value should never come of other people . our value is only from god . i was looking to other people to give me value and they did nt . this was my problem , not the church s .
i though conference was awesome . i have nt watched the nd session from saturday yet but i am going to . it was very interesting how there was a lot of focus on family and getting married and doing what you can to start and be a strong family .

people suspected of being criminals will not be assumed innocent until proven guilty . a sad state of affairs , especially if you consider that the man who is making these statements fought tooth and nail for his right to be assumed innocent in both his rape and corruption cases .
can you imagine living here waking up to that amazing view of the bay every morning it s totally worth having to walk up a steep hill . this was only halfway up , however . i kept climbing , and near the top i looked behind me to capture this
why do we keep losing simple . we keep playing the game using the other guys rules on their field and their ball . all the mayor has to do is say the words wayne theatre , and our side starts falling all over each other about how to respond .
another thing that becomes apparent in draft is that we are starting to develop style and voice . your unique and individual style and voice come through much more clearly when you show things . when you tell them , you sound like everyone else who thinks they can write .
i can understand maybe if santa were a real person , who could actually save us a ton of money by getting our kids a bunch of things they wanted if we could just wait until christmas , but since that is not the case , i 'm not convinced .
we need to love one another again , we need to treat others as more important than ourselves . we need to take an active interest in their needs . it should matter to us what happens to them . we must take care of them an pray for them .
for today 's card , i also wanted to challenge myself to use a gender neutral color palette . of course , i still love my pink and blue for baby cards , but today i went a different route . i hope you 'll like the result i sure do
now i had a choice to make i could listen or ignore the comments . i loved my story loved . it hurt to think that someone did nt love it as much as i did . my initial reaction was to discount the judges to say they were wrong .

what is your expectation do you expect your child to spend hours shopping with you do you expect them to be patient do you expect them to respect you and to know that you respect them children learn what we teach them , they also learn what our expectations are .
i think we can all agree that last night s dialogue session on our zero tolerance policy regarding meat products was beneficial . remember , if it had a parent , we wo nt eat it even though i d love to eat up your adorable children ha , ha .
you see with that call i knew she was gone . i knew that that part of my heart was going to have to break and that i would have to be an adult and accept the fact that she had gone to the big swimming hole in the sky .
i love the wonderful blues greens chocolate colours in the card . the sentiment is just perfect for the man in your life . the clock is stamped and cut out . the man on the bike is embossed with cocoa embossing power , and then popped with foam tape .
from this point forward , as humanity comes into its new self knowing , the desires of the world will be unity . however long it takes to heal the past all past however long it takes to join hearts and minds and purposes , this is a new era .
i 'm again today . been so long my year old now makes my lie look like i had him at . yeah , do n't care . i 'll pretend i had him as a teen even if i so was n't a teen . it 's my lie .
so as you probably know , on monday rd april lots of people all over the place are giving away books that were sent to them by the lovely people at world book night in exchange for their brilliant , original ideas on how to get people reading said books .
i told them , get the whole tape and look at how i tell people we have to get beyond race and start working together , she said , adding later i tried to fight , but i did nt have any support from the united states department of agriculture .
i have nt seen page one but i plan to . one thing you can tell from the review and from promotion the film is receiving is that one of its themes is the importance of the times ' survival . here are parts of the review picking up on that
i have run into another homeless person i starting seeing when i first became homeless . i had thought he had found his way back to permanent housing . but not so . i do n't know where he has been for the months that i did n't see him .
the joy i felt when we transferred the last of our , into the savings account was amazing . such a burden lifted off . making our budget has become a fun time because we can actually put stuff on it besides electricity , water , gas , and food .
i really did nt know what to expect , but i knew that just watching this aircraft take off was going to be exciting jay told me later that if this was the only thing that he had seen the entire three days , that the trip was definitely worth it .
the doctor will match up the set of symptoms to a disease label , and that will give him the correct column on the table of pills to sell . later , the pills themselves will cause new symptoms , which will suggest to the doctor that additional pills are required .
i found a target bag with a box in it that looked like a shoe box . i took it inside and looked to see which boy he bought them for , which is when i realized it was not a show box , but a box holding one of these .
after letting the onions cool slightly , i combined them with a mixture of eggs and half and half , and then poured them into my baked tart shell . the final step was topping the whole thing with the crispy bacon what was left of the bacon , that is .
it s like telling my story for people to know , and relate to . and it makes me happy to see that they listen . you see , i m not the person to person kind . i m sort of a people person . one to many , type .
yes , the boys are good looking . yes , the venture with the boys was definitely an interesting experience . it just was nt a night when true friends got together . i d rather be with the girls whose backs i have and who i know have my back .
and basically you can use anything you want to but your card must have of thing , of another and of another , so for example . you could use papers , flowers and image . that s just an example though it is entirely up to you what you use .
i have n't written on here in awhile . partly b c i am so busy , but at the same time i have been struggling with some stuff that i just did n't want to deal with . and if it is not in writing , then i am fine right
of course , the ultimate test of a good chocolate chip cookie for me is whether it answers this question well did it transport me back to memories of my mini self the answer is yes . this is definitely a winning recipe as far as homemade chocolate chip cookies go .
best of all , though , i do n't have much pain during the day and i actually feel better overall . some of the beer belly might be shifting into other parts of the body or getting burned off entirely . who knows , but this was a pretty successful week
today is our first full day back since we came back from pa again . this is the real deal , because i do n't have that thought of ' oh i 'll see everyone in two weeks when we come back to york ' in the back of my head .
i saw an arm come in the water where i went in but i could n't get to it . then there was an arm behind me , but it did n't find me . then there was another arm where i went in , but it was even farther away .
and that is what i am going to do . i submitted both of these quilts and a third in another show at the end of april . i do n't know if they will be accepted , but it will be interesting to hear what those judges have to say .
the holidays are just around the corner and suddenly i feel the need to knit for people and have so little time left . if you get that feeling too , here are some great last minute knitting ideas that can be done in a few hours to a few days .
however , cereal remained my junk food . i would sit down at least twice a day and have two , sometimes three , bowls at a time . each time i would go through a single bag of milk . that 's a lot of cereal , a lot of milk
or imagine you re one of the . your children are still young , you re still working your way up the corporate ladder , you have your whole life in front of you . and one day you re cooking dinner , but your hand wo nt work . . .
i am getting back into my swing of life . long walks , climbing , friends , trip planning and job seeking . school is on my mind as i try and establish myself , root myself and grow as a person before i have another little person growing in me .
while i do n't understand the appeal , i love that my kids and my husband have such a good time picking these out . now they 're going to sit on the coffee table for a long time and yes , i will probably get around to reading them too .
its been a little wild . we left this morning after only a few days notice and tried really hard to tie up all the loose ends between work and packing everything we need for ourselves and the boys . its been so fun , so stressful , and so exciting .
oh , no , the nurse said , shaking her head , he 's still dead , but he died this morning rather than last night . she held up her hand with a small amount of space between her thumb and index finger . you missed him by that much .
first i was waiting until i had time to do a big long birthday post for the bug , but you know what i did the same thing last year . i will write that , but there has been a lot more going on since the beginning of the month .
and sometimes it costs nothing what i really like is the site s free friday feature , which presents titles which can be download for no cost at all . this particular week offered several recipe books available for your kindle . got ta love anything that s absolutely free , huh
i remember a time years ago when i had to drive back through and i 'd been in the car with screaming sick babies for minutes already . this was not exactly the same as my kids were fine watching a movie , but we were ready to go home regardless .
it 's not a series for professionals , because i 'm not one . it 's a series for me , the me who got my camera three years ago and did n't know what the heck i was doing . i 'm hoping it will be of help to you too
for those guys who are i m tired of angry birds , bored of angry birds , nothing interesting in angry birds . i can tell you one thing . on your face . by far this is one hell of a mobile game they put your index finger to work on .
and in two weeks i will get to hold the babies . feel their skin , their warmth , their breath , hold their tiny hands , peek at their tiny feet . it may only be for a few hours but it will be the most precious hours of my life .
this is what i am seeking to talk to you about for a variety of reasons . first , you know me in ways that others do nt . second , i seek your assistance in putting my best foot forward . third , i was seeking your support in my decision .
i got a suspicious feeling today , because it is friday the th no , not a jason kind of way . i did nt let the feeling get the best of me , and went about my work . i left my desk for a bit and came back to a note
a few years ago i had an early morning routine of walking to the nearby convenience store to get a cup of coffee and a newspaper to start my day . one morning , while it was still dark , i saw an unusual sight in the fellowship hall of our church .
it 's all to do with something called alpha waves . this is n't the place for a detailed examination of the theory and if it were i 'm not the person to do it . it 's controversial of course , but seems to be backed up by some scientific research .
the new year is here , along with all the resolutions to get into shape and have a healthier lifestyle . along with losing pounds , this is the time of year when people think about what better choices they can make in their diet . it s not an easy task .
the ones who helped raise me through elementary to college . thank you for always feeding me , loving me , listening to me , and raising daughters who are amazing women and friends to me . you were very often my ideal when i thought of what a mother should be .
online college degree can help you net the most interesting job around . jobs now a day involve a lot of traveling within the county as well as international travel . traveling to other places and seeing new faces and cultures is an interesting experience that teaches you a lot about life .
most of all , i hope you discover the truth god has revealed to me and many other parents . raising a child with special needs is nt a bad dream . it s just a different dream . and surprisingly , a different dream can be the best dream of all .
so with my friend 's permission and approval , i 'd like to announce this project that i am excited about . one fine blessing this is a project blessing not only senior citizens in our lives , but i can tell you from experience , you will be blessed as well .
we 've had our ups and downs , but through each moment we have been there , holding the other one and reminding them what 's important . i can always count on you to say what i need to hear , even when it 's not what i want to hear .
wrong not according to any of the beer rating sites . lets call them the voice of the people . beer advocate is based on the east coast and rate beer is based on west . so between the two , we can say if a fair voice of the beer nation .
also , if you 're going to ask her why she 's not in school , be prepared for her to tell you she dropped out in the first grade . she has her daddy 's sense of humor . do n't look shocked . laugh instead . she 's being funny .
i finally finished the secret box that i was working on for my tutorial . see my precious posting below or click here if you 're interested . you can make this for any occasion and fill it with other goodies , but i made this one to fill with easter eggs .
i 'm back from weeks of vacation in hawaii we were visiting my husband 's family for a late christmas with them . since i did n't bake at all during vacation , and thus have no baked goods to post about , i 'll show you what i made before our vacation
it 's been awhile since my last post . i have to admit , i 've been getting lazy about it . now that the kids are so mobile , it 's difficult to find time to sit down and sort thru pics , type something up or edit a video clip .
today is my day off . i actually have an early day off since this coming sunday is inventory sunday at work . after today , i will have to work the next days in a row before i am off again . i will be glad to get thru this week .
this is the second post i 've seen today on the importance of character development , so i 'll add my two cents . for me , everything in writing starts with character , including my desire to keep reading or writing . what 's the point of spending time with someone boring
i did n't really take a lot of pictures this weekend , mainly because my phone takes great pictures , but it 's also slow , and that 's frustrating . i think i 'm gon na bite the bullet and buy a camera . every girl needs to document her life .
that got me to thinking . mentally interesting . i really like it . mentally interesting . interesting has a positive ring to it versus the ever negative illness . i think if we work together we can make mentally interesting the politically correct term used to describe people with mental illness .
what it will do is make targets out of us citizens around the world . every action has an equal and opposite reaction . after someone is killed overseas , in the name of allah , do you think terry jones will worry that the blood of that individual is on his hands
this past week has truly been one of the worst weeks ever . i am choosing to not get into it here for many reasons but believe me when i say it was full of bad news and drama and i hope to never go through what we went through ever again .
this recognition happened only one other time in my life , and that was when i met the man who would share more than three decades of my life , but that came years later , and only has a bearing on this story because he also shared my need for truth .
you want to loose weight do it . talking about it does nt make it happen , getting up earlier to go to to the gym , using your lunch break to go for a minute walk , cutting out the evening snacks , is the only way to make it happen .
i was content and satisfied before even knowing this . and yet i am buying into the lie that i can not be happy and content unless i get this can . why should nt i be content and satisfied without buying this can if i have always been satisfied and happy before
first , the disappointing news there 's no indication that mother 's day actually takes place on mother 's day . one would not think that a single line of dialogue to that effect buried in one scene would have been such a big deal , but one would have been wrong .
i ll have that joy tomorrow . i alternate working on the big project with working on others . today i ll be working on a non fiction book . fortunately , it seems to be writing itself . that could mean , of course , that i m writing less well .
she looks at him and wonders why she puts up with his bullshit . and then she realizes , she has no one else . her kids are grown . her parents are old . fuck it , i ll just stick with him , cause i have nothing better to do .
this saturday i woke up around am , after having gone to sleep at around am . needless to say i did nt plan to stay awake all night . it just happened to be that way because a friend was online and i could nt pass on a night of fun .
every friday i will give you tracks that i have been listening to in the week , also love it if people can give me their choices and why . can be anything you like but thought it would be nice to share one of those things that i love the most .
if you re reading this you re probably in the class with me and as such already know all about the assignment but , on the off chance that you re someone new , i ll give a brief explanation of the theme before discussing how i went about gathering these images .
yourself . we always hear about things that build character . in my opinion , saving builds character . to learn the self control required to regularly save and budget your money is no easy task . it will take practice , encouragement and focus to achieve . but it s possible .
i is for integrity . having integrity is being honest and consistent with your values . having integrity means that you are ok with what you see in the mirror . you do what you say you will do , always . people know what to expect from a person with integrity .
with some of my other projects like the master closet , i needed my space and did n't want the little guy 's help . with this , however , we were organizing his own toys , so i felt that it was important to for him take part in the process .
yes , a devastating financial collapse really is coming . just like in , it will seem like the end of the world while it is happening , but it wo n't be . it will severely damage our financial system and our economy , but it will not finish us off .
designing and creating are as much a part of my every day life as breathing . i know other artists who have come to that same conclusion . we are all a sum of our parts . we are who we are because of those parts , not in spite of them .
so how can you do it unfortunately , this type of love does nt have something you can do . it s something only god can do . but because of his great love for you , and his love for your spouse , he chooses to express his love through you .
i did n't dare ask if she planned on going back . she probably was . let 's face it , it was only one argument , despite being an ugly one . she probably could n't have given me an answer at that point anyway , even if i had asked .
what does this mean for you right here , right now this means that you can no longer live by the priorities and expectations of your parents , your culture , your religion , and your peers . you now have to live by your priorities . do you know what they are
it will be a great time for me to think and to explore my options whilst i m doing the trek . with no telephone , no internet and no communication to the outside world apart from the people in my group , it s going to be an interesting learning experience .
i spend way too much time every day thinking about how lucky i am and how cute you are and you 're smart and make good decisions . your dad is head over heels for you and when you smile at him after waking up in the morning it makes his entire day .
i 'm not saying ugly is the new pretty . but i guess i 'm saying beauty is more profound than a beautiful surface . and that it is tied in , for me , with a certain depth that is fed by something beyond that particular picture i 'm taking this moment .
he did have quite a bit of pain at first but that has been getting better as the days go by . his pain patch is working well , and for the most part , he can get by on one or two pain pills per day instead of one every four hours .
the possibilities are endless . the key is to stop listening to others more than you listen to yourself . start listening to the beat of your heart . the heart knows what it wants thoughts in our head talk us out of pursuing our true passion whatever sets our soul on fire .
afterwards , i commented , dude , that was pretty funny language was a little in your face though . i said this for my mother s benefit , because there were some words and phrases in there that i really am sure she has nt had too much experience with . her response
so as you think about christmas this year please keep in mind that it does n't matter what you do n't have or ca n't afford what matters is what you do have . the gifts that you ca n't buy in stores are often the one 's that are the most precious .
yet , despite all this , i walked into the gap this weekend . i was desperate for some new basics , had exhausted all my other shopping options , and could n't help but be drawn in by a giant red sign in the window screaming , buy any top get one free
i was still working hard for him , harder every week , just because i wanted him to be happy and i thought that if i worked harder , he d realise how necessary i was to his business and he would change his mind about paying me , even a little bit .
it is a risk . if we do nt reach the goal , we will not get the money at all . and , honestly it is scary . but the good thing is , that my believe that we will reach the goal is bigger than my fear that we will not .
so , i find myself in an interesting dilemma . who s to say how things will work out but i will most definitely keep writing , and making videos , and in general just living my life . and we ll just have to wait and see how things go from there .
i wish ann romney had said something like , i was very lucky . for me , it was nt a choice between staying home with the kids and going to work . she could have then gone on to praise women who need to leave their kids and work outside the home .
just how much do you know about american history a quick survey has convinced me that a lot of people must have used that class to catch up on their sleep when they went to school . well , i 'd like everyone 's attention today because there will be a pop quiz later
as we turned onto the street i looked around and liked what i saw . when we got into the house i liked it even more . small , but cute . fairly move in ready which is important for a seven month pregnant lady . no catch time to put in an offer
we could obviously spend all day talking about this and still not cover every potential scenario . so think about the places where you spend the most time and make a specific plan for each location . the more prepared you are , and the more you consider specific circumstances , the better prepared
this book is a fun teen book with a good amount of cheese . it s cheesy , however , i think that life needs a bit of cheese every now and again and as long as it is nt a constant thing i enjoy a cheesy book every once in a while .
last weekend 's baby shower went well the mom to be looked fabulous with her basketball baby bump and my gift of a handmade baby album was well received . i 'm always nervous giving a handmade gift to someone so it was quite a relief to hand it over and see smiles .
i changed images , but kept her layout and overall color scheme . i am on a mission to use things i have had for a long time . this tag is one of them , so i ca n't even remember where the images are from if you know , let me know
second he had posted on another forum . the coins will be going off soon as we have days to actually hand them in , the farmer wanted to see them it s the least we could do . it is indeed the least they can do considering the coins are nt their property
however , when we tried to search the location with our car , we could n't hear the music any longer . we just drove around the campus and this college is huge it felt like a whole mountain was the campus of this college . it is very green and beautiful college .
you do n't need to spend an enormous amount of time on this either even if you have just minutes , this time will definitely help you gain more skill and feel more comfortable with free motion quilting . check out this post to find a quick way to practice every single day .
as for you children , nobody is ever too young to surrender to jesus , you can surrender your life to him today and he will turn you into a star . so those of you who want to give your life to jesus whether parent or their children , you can come now
it was an exciting era , to be sure . if you want to know more about it , you can probably ask one of the many current leaders who came into the field as young professionals then just do nt tell them they may be part of a problem we re facing today .
next post i promise to cook something and take more pictures . this has been a bad work week and i 'm hoping it will slow down a bit soon . not to mention i should be getting in a care package from a buddy in alaska midnight sun sometime in the coming weeks .
studying abroad . that would be cool , but i do nt have that kind of time or money . this is what most of you reading this are saying , right well if you d like to sit through this little word presentation , i d like to try to convince you otherwise .
children need support to learn these skills . the idea is that your child takes charge of his or her space by moving away and , if need be , setting boundaries as soon as a problem is about to start so that your child does n't wait until the bullying is already happening .
i feel awful that i have n't gotten around to a thank you before now . i 'm now feeling much better although the heat is still causing me some problems . at least i can blame everything on baby between company , traveling , and life time has been short the past while .
this is just a scene of a group of boys talking , but what they say and how they say it tells us so much about what kind of kids they are and what has brought them to this point . you already want to spend the next couple hours hanging out with them .
think about the people you know that seem to know everyone in your community or your industry . the people that draw you in and have that way of making you take note of the things they are saying . the folks who get things done no matter how impossible the task may seem .
the last time we really spent much time with her and my uncle was before we moved to korea i was , to give some perspective . we visited briefly when we came back three years later , but since they live way up in ny , we just never really made it back .
next on the list are beers number through . give me a bit of time to taste test these and i ll post another brew update soon . in the meantime , if any readers out there have some spare summer clothes , please drop me a line . i can arrange pick up .
i slept for a long , long time . it was nice . i got up and checked on the bunny . out like a light . i decided to shower while i had the chance and even dried my hair . after all , we had a christmas party to go to tonight .
every mile or so i would think do i have more . pause . then , hell yes i do . it started that way and eventually it was yes , i do no screaming but always a positive , yes , i have more and never was it no , i ca nt .
another long post but one i had to write in order to reply effectively to your good self . sometimes it 's not possible to write a few words to explain a situation . i always do in order to not leave out any important facts . that 's why my posts are long .
i 've learned that it 's okay to lean on your friends when you need to . i 'm very independent by nature , and i like it that way but sometimes you need a little help to get by , and i 've learned that it 's okay to rely on others sometimes .
these things just do nt interest me . yes , i would like to visit other countries , and of course i would fly first class if i had to chance . i have turned down chances to meet celebrities , simply because i think i show more respect to give them their space .
and if you go in , should you turn left or right or right and three quarters or , maybe , not quite or go around back and sneak in from behind simple it s not , i m afraid you will find , for a mind maker upper to make up his mind .
this week was a short one for me , yay i worked just three days and took two days off to come to houston for errands and to visit m 's family for the weekend , so no need to explain how relaxed i feel right now . here are my favorites for this week
i like all kinds of stuff . and i am constantly finding new stuff to add to my already growing list of things that i want , which totally does nt help and makes it really hard to save for those big ticket items when you find so many smaller things to buy instead .
part of my business plan includes promotion , for writers today one of the most effective ways to promote is to build a platform . quite simply , this is just the space where you market yourself . if your platform is effective it can help guide readers to your books and generate sales .
in a recent conversation with a new friend , she asked , does it really matter to the lord what i do for a job she is afraid to ask god what he thinks . why because she is afraid she might find out god 's will requires a radical change in her life .
so instead of the traditional dinner that we did n't have space or money for we decided to treat ourselves to our favourite food . indian . as with a normal thanksgiving meal we were eating it for about three days after the big day . i know it took up less space though .
we often post about brands we admire , many you have heard of . this next one could be the exception unless you re in the film video industry , that is . among these folks , the mention of a red camera brings any discussion to a different level . here s why .
if you want to be of use to god , maintain the proper relationship with jesus christ by staying focused on him , and he will make use of you every minute you live yet you will be unaware , on the conscious level of your life , that you are being used of him
carefully place your jars into the large pot of boiling water being sure to have them resting on something so that they are n't sitting on the bottom of the pot . make sure the water covers the top of the jars by at least inch . cover and let process for about minutes .

that 's really all it takes to write a successful press release . it 's a unique writing exercise that gives us the opportunity to create another effective marketing tool for our books . there is a world full of free press out there and now you know how to grab some of it .
roses , however , might just work . they seem to do well in almost every planting zone and they actually like sunlight , which is a good thing around these parts . i 've been doing a little researching about growing roses before i get started , in hopes that i might have gardening success
i 've said goodbye since then to people older than my year old mother in law . some were expected . some were n't . but they were easier because i was n't as close . i was n't as invested . that changed this past may when i had to say goodbye to christopher .
do you get as excited and overwhelmed as we do about yard work does it ever get to the point where you feel like you can truly say it is finished and you get to just sit back and relax in your yard if not , please , pretty please , just lie to me .
but it s not just technology that keeps us connected . it s the bond that we create with the ones that we love that allows us to feel their joy and their pain even when we re worlds apart . it s the shared experiences and memories that keep them in our hearts always .
my precious mother in law , barbara went home to jesus last night . she was truly the strongest woman of faith i have ever known . her years on this earth truly made it a much more wonderful place . i never heard her utter one negative word or complaint throughout her entire illness .
what makes for effective social media promotion there are a great deal of answers to that question but the simple summary is that regardless of whether you are working on music promotion for a band or shoe promotion for a shoe store , social media has to be a factor and part of your budget .
we will hit months on saturday . i can not believe it they are sleeping from between and at night until about am . i never thought we would hit this but we have . they are talking to us , and smiling and laughing . i am having so much fun with these babies .
i am a small business leader , owner . i do nt plan on running a person company , or a person company . i have people and i want to be a better leader , and keeping things simple . i know my character is the driving force behind whether i succeed or not .
in a second experiment , adults were shown either a neutral video or an emotional video about children in poverty . they were then given fake dollars and told they could give as much as they liked to a stranger . those who were less religious gave more when they saw the emotional video first .
it was within the next hour that the noise started in the room next door . first it was the tv , then the voices . lots of voices . i 'd say there were at least people in there if not more . and that continued . past . past . on past midnight .
simple . let 's say you want a normal , middle class american standard of living , and congress tells you that means you should spend up to , a year . you 'd better take a loan out fast , because where i come from , ai n't many people who actually earn that .
i 've made a promise to purchase something handmade once a month . this purchase , whether big or small , helps to keep an artist working , and telling you about my purchase helps to give them exposure they might not otherwise have . besides , i love to show off my handmade purchases .
on the whole , great film , great story , and wonderfully told . i might not be around for a while because i m going to need to go walking around in the woods , looking for holes in the ground that will give me special powers . wish me luck and watch out .

there are two things about these seven letters that repeat in each letter . i learn by seeing patterns and common things , so this jumped out at me . also , it s generally accepted that if something happens more than once in the bible , it s best to pay attention to it .
i just want to know from anyone out there that is or has been in a similar situation what is your advice how do you run a business , take care of kids a husband and a house and take care of yourself especially when what i really want to do is take a nap .
god has been moving mountains in the past few months , all in preparation for , i believe , the news we got yesterday i have been praying so hard that our home study would be approved and god would direct us to the son he has chosen for us . yesterday , he did that
i am coming to think however , that to ' get organized ' is not really the destination . i am beginning to wonder if it is n't more of a never ending path journey . where each day we make the choice of doing something that helps us accomplish our other goals or not .
i believe every woman has her shopping vice . for some , it s make up . for others , it s hair care products . some women have a particular fabric that they ca nt resist . my mother never met a silk article of clothing that she did nt have to own immediately .
i just smiled . i did nt say a word . there was no need . after another minute or so , i finally spoke , i ll stay right here , and keep you company , for as long as you wish . and when you re ready , then we ll go back .
but do nt get me wrong , i also love it . i love helping wherever i can in the church , i love the people i get to work with , and i love focusing on the future . it was just a lot of other things on the week leading up to camp .
he has a big conscience and wants to do what is right . his school class wrote him letters for his birthday , and one girl wrote i like that you always do what you think is right . that 's cole , he hates to be in trouble and wants to do what is right
i just wonder what my previous post was all about the importance of sitting with a dying person . i feel used . i 'm sure i was a great comfort to my husband but at what cost would i have done it had i known what i know now i just feel so used .
no , i m not offended . i m not angry . i m not anything at all , except very sad , and sad to a profound depth that even i m surprised at feeling , having concluded long ago that it s rare for me to feel much of anything , any longer .
the time for them to understand the concept is yet to come then why did god not just create humans with the ability to understand these concepts so god wants us to believe and understand his word , but he does nt give us the mental capacity to do it does nt make much sense .
where do you turn in times of trouble where do you turn in times of joy how about distress , celebration , sadness , etc . can you say you keep your eyes fixed on him in all things do others see him in you is god your priority are you seeking his attention or others
i guess what s so disturbing about the situation is that you get a house in a remote location so that you can escape the noise and people of the city , only to have some person show up and you ca nt escape them . i m tempted to never come up here again .
the following day , i looked up from my tea and noticed the young lady again repeating the exact steps she took the day before . i looked at my watch and concluded that this was part of her routine . i decided at that moment , i would also become part of that routine .
got some left over lettuce from a party in my house and i decided to stir fried it using the recipe that i learned from chef michael smith of chef at home show in asian food channel . he used spinach for this recipe but i decided to go ahead with the leftover crisp head lettuce .
she has n't . i do n't want her to , because i also have a second purpose in my report , or homework as i often call it . i want him to get a picture of my state of mind . what i can do and ca n't . what i think is important .
that s no true . i know i m good . i always have . and i constantly fight for something brilliant to appear . i want praise . acceptance . smiles . money . i m human . i want to be recognized . but more than it all , i want to be happy .
my great friend , paul , helped me to get things cleaned up , and finished up with our bill as i took natalie down the back stairs and to the car . the poor dear , feeling so bad knew we had to go home to get cleaned up and her tummy was still hurting .
the reason for picking this color was because my kids wanted a pink room , but i am not a huge fan of pink colors . i do like some shades of pink and this tone was one of the pink shades that i like . it gives a soft and sweet look to the room .
this time i made a layout . the papers already have all the glitter and sparkle that you might need , so all you have to do is arrange your photos , add some embellishments and your layout is good to go . easy , fun and shiny as it should be for a kid 's project
in related news , another teacher received a small heart box with chocolate . it was one of those boxes that holds three pieces of chocolate . this one held one piece of chocolate , with a bite taken out . the other two spots where chocolate should have been held three little jelly beans each .
whether you make it yourself , hire someone to make it , have a family member or a friend make it , get it from the thrift store , or buy it off the rack make it mean something . make it special . even if you are having fun with it its a big deal .
and i thought , oh my god , that is so kind of hot and it s just like those curtains my mother in law made me for the office , like , years ago . except those are not hot , but man , what a great post this would make and then i saw this
alright . so i know this is pretty late but yes , let 's get started so yep , today , i 'm gon na talk about my favorite genre , or rather , sub genre . historical romance . romance itself is amazing , but historical romance tops the chart . at least for me .
my approach has changed since . in i did a picture for each day . in i relaxed on the picture a day and just put in the pictures that i had over the week . they may have been from several days and sometimes even just a couple of days . will be similar to .
that s it today is the day to accept a new path and a new beginning . the journey must start here and there is no looking or turning back . this thing i have become does not represent the woman i am . today we say goodbye to one another and a new life begins .
thank you each and everyone for helping with this project and sharing your talents with others . your love and support makes my day happier and i know touching the lives of these families must make you feel appreciated . thank you for being here and helping us . you are well loved and deeply appreciated .
best of all , it 's a super easy recipe . the only ingredient i had to go out of my way for was sour cream , which is easy enough to arrange . this would be great for a dinner party , a tea , or just to have around the house as a snack .
there will undoubtedly be plenty else happening in the world at the same time . so it looks like we re about to enter a pretty exciting time in this most exciting of years . for my part , if i m not publishing quite as much as i have , chances are i m resting .
but why should i have all the fun have a look below at some of the photos i took and see a bit of what i saw at the festival of chocolate . if it ever comes near you in the future , then be sure you check it out , especially if you have nt before
i did nt watch enough of this to really feel comfortable rating it . i enjoyed aspects of the first season , but felt the show was a bit thin . if i ever get around to watching subsequent seasons and they show improvement than i could see this finding its way onto the top ten .
and that 's it easy , right i hope this encourages some of you to dig out the sewing machine , brush off the dust , and get sewing . i have n't been sewing long , and i 'm amazed at how easy it really is . if i can do it , so can you
normally , it would n't be a big deal , but that means it 'll be twelve hours before i see my little boy again , and then he 's going to have to go straight to bed as are we if we expect to be awake and ready to go on time the next morning .
good people , why are you doing these things we are men with the same feelings as you , and we give you the good news so that you may be turned away from these foolish things to the living god , who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all things in them
i can not imagine living in a nation that calls itself a democracy , talks about human rights and the rule of law , and does this sort of thing , but i do live in that nation . more and more i am coming to believe that nothing we say actually means anything . nothing .
because of your kind remarks , i 'm much more comfortable in my clothing choice for the big day . heck , you 'd think i 'm the bride with as much thought and preparation i 've put into this at any rate , i promise to tell you all about it next week . thanks again
here s the point though they might begin as a response to real events , panic attacks are more likely to occur in the face of imagined danger . it takes a lot of professional and personal support and practice for an individual suffering from anxiety to realise that they re actually not physically at risk .
after class , i was thinking about all of the responsibility that lies on the shoulders of moms . every chemical they are exposed to , every food product they consume while pregnant it all affects the health and development of their child . that s a lot of responsibility , but it s only the beginning
if i make the mistake of leaving him alone with the laptop again , then it is my fault if he pulls off more keys . it 's not that he should know better . he has clearly shown that he does not know better for now . i 'm the one who should know better .
or when his mother asked him to save the wedding party that ran out of wine . he explained to her that he really was n't supposed to start in with the miracles just yet . but he did do what his mother asked and changed the water into wine . really good wine at that .
the pro s , those that heard of the fund drive for new tree s , gave . some of them did nt . in two cases i discovered they had never been in the cemetery at all , either with the old trees , or now with the planting going on but they had an opinion .
now to fishing , this for the most part has been a sad story . you see were in the middle of a seasonal current change and this means dirty water and cold water for the time being . for the last couple of weeks this has been the case , but there are signs of change .
this is an ideal work to be used in a classroom . giving children knowledge of this disease before he or she has to actually face it , as many , many will , gives them a bit of a head start in the process of learning to deal with the many issues they will be faced .
i remember today to live life fully and completely . for this day will never again be repeated . what and how i use this very day is my choice and i choose to make it my best day ever when tomorrow comes i will look back and remember just how glorious the day was and smile .
walking back to my car after the awards ceremony , i was stopped by a couple that said they had seen me running around town . of course , they thought i was nuts at first , but after a few minutes of answering their questions , they were intrigued and ready to look into it more .
introduction i have been friends online with a woman from australia , on and off again , due to various circumstances in our lives since . she is one of my very best friends , and she probably knows me better , on a more deeply personal level than almost all of my real life friends do .
the secure leader gives confidence to those following because the more refreshing you are the more people want to follow you . if you bring answers , and positive attitude to the situation it makes it better . if you bring fear , threats , and blame to the situation no one wants to follow you anywhere .
it s even more important than ever to come up with a good idea . an idea that can work across all channels and where each channel can communicate a different , self contained element of the brand narrative but in combination with exposure to others will build to create a larger brand world . a idea .
i think week four was the worst , in a general sense . two of the seven days were terrible runs , but the bright side is i totally learned a lesson . apparently it was an important one , because i made the same mistake twice . i think god might have been telling me something here
yes , but i love drawing , so i do n't mind making ones that are n't exactly what i had in my mind . i like figuring out how to create it the way i want , and that means a lot of time trying and practicing until i get it just as i like it .
we were blessed to spend time with family that we have n't seen for along time and enjoyed a warm christmas . here a few of the pictures . i have n't post lately but i am going to start again and so you few readers are n't so bored with my once a month or so post
there s also the job searching networking theory of putting yourself out there . i guess that s good for a lot of things . if you want something good to happen to you , it s a little foolish to hide out at home , talking to no one . it simply ca nt find you .
a common belief is that this is a mental illness . that i am sick in the head . i need help . that a visit to the doctor s office will change things , make me well again . well i m sorry to disagree , but they could nt be more wrong in that regard .
angel beats was an anime that i went into not knowing much about it and left it feeling like i had been told a very nice and satisfying story that moved a little too fast and had maybe a few plot holes in it . nonetheless it is still a good series that is worth looking into .
i was pretty pleased with what they offered . now , to be fair , i have not spent days and days in the software , but i did spend about hours in it , playing and figuring things out . i did not watch any tutorial , but i know there are some , including this one
but now i do n't let people in . if you have a friend who , when you pick her up , she meets you outside her door , or if you bring something by , she meets you at the door and does n't let you in more than likely , she 's messy . and ashamed .
then god led our hearts to long even stronger than before to return home . we needed a few things to fall in line for that to happen and most importantly matt would need a job . one by one those little details began to change and fall in line . now all matt needed was a job .
we decided to walk to the park near our house , and the girls tried to sell their remaining comic there , and a few stuffed animals , with no luck . it was a beautiful day and everyone was too busy playing they were satisfied with their sales for the day and had fun in the park .
i thought i had given up my job to come home and start a family with my husband . he , being six years older than me , had wanted that for awhile . it took me a little longer to get to that spot but that is the stage of life i thought we had reached together .
a new day is interesting and very well told , but not once did i feel as though i were in control of the action . for those who ca n't get enough of the walking dead universe , it 's ideal . those after an actual game from their game will find themselves a little more disappointed .
i picked her up by the waist after our photo shoot and this is where my foot stopped her neck . i could n't resist one more picture . a few more inches and it would have rolled into the deep end of the pool . fortunately , a little glue will take care of this minor problem .
when my mom and dr j were here for our wedding , dr j forgot some clothes in the guest room closet . my mom asked me to send them to her house . when she sent me money for my birthday a month later , she included . to cover the shipping for dr j 's stuff .
but our pastor read it this way , i say to you today fear not , for i bring you good news of great joy , that is for all people including you and me . for on that day in the city of david there has been born for you a savior who is christ the lord .
she starts this week two hours a day , three days a week . she keeps telling me , mama , you 're going to miss me so much when i 'm at school . she 's not going to miss me . i 'm going to miss her . and you know what she 's probably right .
funny how such a small change can balance out a whole display . i 'm always moving things around on there so a few other things changed too ... i feel like my before and after should be in a highlights magazine . does anyone else remember those , with the spot five things that are different photo games
i think this is the best i ever spent totally love how it turned out next up i am going up the wall i am going to make a gallery wall above the shelf . so how high do you think that should go all the way to the ceiling or to a foot or so from the top
wow looks like i am behind again on my goal to review beers a week beers . i should be on right now but as you can see i am only on . i can probably get up to this weekend but we will see there is a lot of time left this year to make it happen .
i have anxiety so the mess raises my anxiety level super high . i 've got about half done by noon on a wednesday , so i should be happy , but lord , i 've still got at least loads of laundry , vacuum the whole house and do n't even get me started on the bathroom .
hi everyone i 've really missed creating cards with floral images and this one so reminds me of spring . i 'm also loving this thrift shop paper pad so i 'm sure you 'll be seeing more of it . the image used on today 's card is the flower basket digital stamp by clear dollar stamps .
this is for a sweet sixteen who has a plan for her future . i will stand for her until she can do that for herself . she , like all of your children , deserves the best we can give them . this current government is not doing their best , not for her or anyone else .
though i am completely exhausted from non stop house work this weekend , it is nice to look back and see all that was accomplished . i barely have enough energy to write this post so bear with me . at least when i started it i felt that way . that s probably why it took me days .
that did result i think who am i to truly know in my being able to write pretty much anything in any style under pressure . and , because i also interviewed people for magazines , i knew the difference between writing for the human voice in vision and out of vision and writing for different types of print .
what a year this has been i can not believe how quickly months has gone by . it seems like yesterday i was pregnant and putting away christmas decorations , and here i am , staring at a decorated christmas tree waiting for the ball to drop on december , with two healthy and beautiful little girls asleep upstairs .
so , ok . throughout the book , we 've seen that love has a real cost . jamie and claire have built a relationship through honest struggle , a relationship that 's worth what it 's cost them . this is the final challenge , and jamie 's willing to pay what will apparently be the ultimate cost .
. playing basketball . last summer , i played close to two hours of ball almost every week night . it was amazing . i d never felt that good in my life , and i had so much fun and really improved in all aspects of my game . i m looking to do something similar this summer .
so first off , what kind of guy takes a girl out on a blind date when in less than hours she will be set apart as a missionary yeah , i do n't know either . but that is happening to me , in t minus minutes . plant a seed i guess . it should be quite enjoyable
we started out talking about what types of goals to set . you can set goals concerning any area of your life relationships , business , personal , health , education . the list could go on and on . find the area of your life that you would like to work on and define what your goals are .
the book is not perfect , but it was the right book at the right time for me . i read it in one sitting , and while i ca nt see reading it to the boys at this point , i do think that any book loving child or adult could find a happy escape into its pages .
once the light are turned on , we do not correct what we might see as mistakes , we dry the piece , and continue the process in the light . personal images may be discovered that we may choose to embrace or obscure . in the end , the painting may heal or merely tell a personal story .
if it s the first draft , i write it long hand . rather than writing in a space , i walk around the house while writing . this is probably because i m one of those people who hate sitting down for far too long . not to mention that walking around makes for great , simple exercise .
as mentioned in the post about my birthday party , one of the wonderful presents i got was a kindle . my sister has one , too , and she created a shared account for it on amazon , where i have created a wish list to which both of us can add books we want to download eventually .
before i knew it however , a trip to the supermarket , a cross atlantic swap , an online order or two later , this is what i ended up with . these will be tested out and reviewed in time . do you have a preference for what you want to see first i might be able to accommodate
the thing is , the tension does n't have to be life or death , although that 's of course one of the strongest ways to do it . it could be simply that two siblings do n't get along and it creates tension because you the reader , care about the fact that they are not getting along .
you will have a difficult life for some part of it , but that is what will make you the beautiful and strong young lady you will grow up to be . at one point life will get hard and you will do something stupid , but in the end you will realize that it was not worth it .
we can not control the reactions of others . however , although people may initially react when you change the way you are by speaking honestly , in the end it raises the relationship to a whole new and healthier level . either that or it releases the unhealthy relationship from your life . either way , you win .
i really really like soccer because i love the way it goes on and on and there is no stopping , even if some one is hurt and has to be carried off the field maybe some added minutes at the end , but otherwise there is none of this going on forever stuff you get in american football .
at the end of the first day , we were exhausted and hungry and sad . it was hard to be there and the faint memory of those warm fuzzy feelings from that morning were just that , a faint memory . in total , we spent about a week there and between four and five hours per day .
welcome to the ultimate movie lover 's giveaway we wanted to help you put together the best family movie night for you and your family so we put together another amazing giveaway , that includes everything you need for your night in . from movies to popcorn and candy you will have everything you need for a great movie night .
an open ended question is designed to encourage a full , meaningful answer using the subject s own knowledge andor feelings . it is the opposite of a closed ended question , which encourages a short or single word answer . open ended questions also tend to be more objective and less leading than closed ended questions see next page .
so here is my question then , is it wrong to call me a racist when this is what they do this is the reason i do nt trust them , this is the reason i do nt want to be associated with them and this is the reason why i do nt want to share this country with them .
mj has a lovely engagement ring which i also failed to photograph and seems really , really happy . in fact , i had commented on her happiness before she showed me the ring . they are only barely thinking about wedding planning at this point . mj says it will probably not take place for a couple of years .
god always answers prayer . sometimes he says yes sometimes he says no and sometimes he says , wait a minute . and since to the lord a day is the same as a thousand years pet . , that could mean a ten year wait for us . so ask in faith , but rest in peace filled patience .
it 's amazing how many times i 've watched this video in the last few days . to be honest , i sort of found it by accident while trying to find another version of the song . despite its being minutes long , i decided to watch it anyways , and i ca n't seem to stop watching it .
while the above will help you keep the big power items under control , there are measures you can take that will cut smaller bits off your bill . some of them require you to spend some money , or make some effort , in order to save in the long run . but they re all worth the trouble .
everything i do , i want to question whether i could be doing it better . am i using my resources as well as i can am i focusing on the task at hand enough are there other ways to tackle a problem am i being present enough can i save more , do more , be more and give more
if you focus and work hard at the task at hand , it seems to fall into place . focus and work hard at cleaning and organizing the house . focus and work hard when it is time to fix meals . when family , friends , neighbors and loved ones need you , focus and give them quality time .
the other day , i was getting her a drink while i was holding her . i put the lid on the cup and said , now what do we need and she said , straw . i need to remember to ask things like that more often . to give her the chance to show me what she knows .
why and when did we stop believing that when did we decide that a full colour world full of magic and courage and friendship and challenge was something that only happened in our dreams when did we decide that nothing can be new or exciting or different when did we start believing that adventures were nt something we could really have
i know that ultimately , i will not be working there forever , it is just a matter of when the job ends , not if . people tell me i should quit but this is where i have my health insurance and frankly , i do n't know if i am up to starting a new job right now .
there 's something to be said for friends who connect with us on a deeper level . they get us . they stand by our side and remind us just how strong and amazing we are when we sometimes forget . they do n't see our flaws , or care if we ca n't fit in to our skinny jeans .
politicians in washington and in city hall like to use small businesses as a symbol of their concern for the average citizen . they are forever using wall street as their symbol for the bad guys and main street as their symbol for the good guys . as a small business owner , i find this offensive in the extreme .
there is nt just one way to write that paragraph and have it work . i know y all want the silver bullet that will assure your query letter the attention it deserves but as you can see from the list of comments left on yesterday s entry , readers had different opinions on which one worked best for them .
well , i prayed each and every night for many weeks after that . asking the lord to help me find my birth mother . that this was so very important for me . i needed to know her , i needed to find her and i needed to tell her that i did nt hate her for giving me up
this past week just past to fast . i have n't been able to even read very much here , less would i have been able to write . so sorry for that . i am saying all the time , that i want to talk also about other stuff , but time is just passing faster as i can run
what about the child who definitely understands the concept , but does poorly on the test because he forgot to show his work because he did n't need to do any work to get the answer or because he is sick or distracted because of some tragic situation going on in his life does that mean he does not know it
it 's very sad to hear them fighting , and sometimes concerning . we keep an ear out to be sure that there is no domestic violence going on if it seemed too serious , we 'd call authorities to check in on things . as it is , it just sounds like a couple that ought not stay together .
but the real power of the script came in the writers ability to tell a story . again , so many new writers focus on how to string words together . and it 's not that that is nt important . it is . but it 's not nearly as important as telling the story and keeping the reader interested .
he loves to count to read words from his homework book show us the letter number they worked on that day loves getting a new library book each week has made some great friends he is getting good at reading signs , names of stores etc around town sing songs they learn in class and much more i 'm sure .
we really have no control over of what happens to us . we can not stop the car from breaking down . the plane will be late arriving , which throws our whole schedule off . a driver may cut us off in traffic . we have no control over this . the other is different . you determine the other .
after two minutes had passed it still had a fucking plus sign . i re read the instructions hoping that plus sign meant , it 's a plus that you are n't knocked up but no , it meant it 's a plus that you know who the baby daddy is luckily it comes with two tests . i tried again .
i do this for me . i do this to be a good role model . and i do this to show that i am not always available to drop everything for others . sounds funny but i want my family to respect that some things are important to me . and i deserve time to pursue my dreams and goals .
i feel a little defeated , but i know that once i get back to it , and re sew those pieces so that they lay right , i ll be back on track . it just may take a little time for me to be willing to pick it up again . maybe tomorrow . i ll let you know .
prayer lord , help me be patient with all of your people and know when it is time to be quiet and wait for you to save them , as only you can do . i ask this , as always , in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy spirit . amen .
what makes this whole thing worse is that there was guests . who really wants to go and watch this kind of things other than the owners i can imagine it just being a really , really uncomfortable sort of thing to sit through . it s bad enough watching some of today s stars get married , let alone dogs .
and if you do n't live close by or ca n't make it , fear not i am going to offer instructions by email andor a kit so you can still enjoy making this album yourself in the comfort of your own home . just keep an eye on my website and i 'll let you know when the info is ready
and with the black heels , some of those shoes were so beat up , it was a wonder i still had them . i ended up throwing out at least of those heels , donated others and still had that had enough diversity in them to suit me just fine . it was onto the second part of the project .
someone told me the other day that can sometimes be worse than but it does nt last forever no , it gets better . they start to understand consequence and punishment . they start to like saying yes instead of no . they enjoy pleasing you and helping you around the house and being around you . then they turn . damn
i m lucky to live in a state where i see this positive , problem solving behavior in some of my representatives . therefore , my first letter for project appreciation is a hand written letter to one of my state representatives , expressing my specific appreciation and thanks . i will drop the letter in the mail later this week .
easter is right around the corner and hopefully you 'll come join in our challenge fun and get those last minute easter cards ready and in the mail at the same time i was running behind a bit this week with being out of town for days attending the workshop at joan 's gardens but finally got something created last night .
readers , i realize that what i m about to share with you hardly counts as creative writing . in fact , i m not even going to try to pass it off as writing . what follows is in no way my own creation . but i could nt bear to pass up the opportunity to share this with you .
and to wrap things up for the weekend , i made this breakfast that i had mentioned in last week 's breakfast post here . i thought they were really tasty and came out perfectly if you have to make breakfast for a large group , it 's a great way to get the eggs cooked all at the same time .
i do not know how many events your crew has covered since carnival season started back in november , , but just a couple of more days before it 's all over and then you get to rest . . . yeah right . you see , julia 's getting married next month so i know there will be no rest .
it is kind of a funny feeling knowing that the whole country can stay informed of our circumstances via the news but we do nt know what s going on because our electricity , television , and internet is out of service . i found one little pocket where my g will work which is how i am writing this now .
how are you today it 's thursday , and that means it 's time to link up all the stuff you 're doing right now to consume less and produce more . next week i 'll be sharing some of my homemade gifts for the holidays , but in the mean time you can get plenty of ideas from the other contributers
that 's it from me , remember the sale is still on , there 's around different items still left so if you 're after a bargain , then it 's worth checking out have a good week , i might even get to post again later in the week , if my cable does ever arrive it is driving me insane
which then brought me to the realization that one day in the not distant enough future my children would leave me , my dogs will pass on and i will be left with only my husband . i started to panic a little until i came to the realization that i could always buy another dog . that helped a little .
i should have left the job i once had back in october of . but i did nt . because i felt it was my responsibility to stay , and do the best i could to support the program i had been working on . for i did not wish to cause any difficulty for those that worked on the program .
no matter who you have to buy for , if it s a woman , i ll let you in on something , the easiest thing to buy for us beauty products we love them , we ca nt have enough , that s right , even if you think we have enough , we want more , and lots of them
it took me over , entries probably close to , for me to feel that i am getting the hang of what is good and what my style is . so i say before you have published at least entries do nt make snap judgement too quickly . you are still learning . and i still consider myself learning by doing .
out of the blue she tells me she wants to shoot a turkey . now , she s been shooting with me before on a few occasions and has genuinely enjoyed herself . she s not a bad shot either but she had never expressed any interest in hunting actually killing something . and i d never asked her to go .
many people say that celebrities are not normal anymore when they become famous . well , needless to say , that s not true at all . sure , some celebrities let the whole famous thing get to their heads , but most celebrities that i m a huge fan of , do nt let being famous take over their lives .
we may experiment in the next few months with putting up shade cloth over parts of the garden to see if the plants fair better . our strawberries did much better last summer after we put up the shade cloth . otherwise we were losing plants every week , and not from lack of water . it was actual burn out .
while verbal abuse seems difficult to define but easy to commit , you can change your ways how it s pretty simple , whenever you feel annoyed or in an aggressive mood , stay calm there s no need for insults or verbal attacks . breathe deeply , count to ten and suggest that the other persons actions may have annoyed you .
on nights like tonight i think about that chinese couple . i have no idea if they live in england , or moved back to china , or if life brought them somewhere else . i like to think that , wherever they are , they re fighting cancer and cooking together each and every night . it s a comforting thought .
they are also in the loop of believing in a conspiracy and there is nothing you can say or do which will change their mind . any evidence which supports their theory supports their theory , and any evidence which does nt support their theory , was just planted there to cover up the conspiracy , and proves the conspiracy even more .
instead of putting the little circle on the bag first i did this and the bag always closed back shut , put the circle on the tube unit . then stick the tube unit into the bag and it will open the bag and keep it open while you put on the circle and squeeze together the tube unit and the circle .
sometimes it 's hard to find the words . over the last few days , i 've found myself using the phrase ' beyond words ' many times . but the thing is , we 're writers . we have to find the words . this is my attempt to find the right words to pay tribute to a very special person .
not the reaction i was expecting . i dug in my heels . the writing books say to write what you feel . use your writing as your space to be true and go ahead and write without worries of what others think . it s not about you , it s my writing , my journey i dug myself in deeper .
today i am focused on the grocery list , however , and getting some food into the house for us to eat over then next five weeks that 's all we have until closing it will be tricky to find the balance between having enough and none left over to move , but i am sure i can rise to the occasion .
moving on the real stuff . part of the reason that i waited until today to post this movie review instead of writing it yesterday is that i was nt quite sure of my opinion of this movie at first . to be honest , i still ca nt totally make up my mind . but mostly , i enjoyed this movie .
but i 'm doing pretty well considering . i 'm only a couple of days behind . i still need to clean a room this week , clean out my medicine cabinet , and hang a piece of artwork . i stopped on the way home from work today my first day in my own city this week and got some flowers .
i am just back from going to lunch with my husband and children , who are in town for the week . there was nothing particularly outstanding about this lunch at a regular restaurant with typical but good pub food . yet this will be a memorable day for all of us , because we had a wonderful time together as a family
this is actually my journal entry from last week for my core class . it s a bit of a rant because i did nt want to or more like i just could nt bring myself to do any of the exercises because of stuff i was going through at the time , which i will get into in the journal itself .
then , of course , i 'm moving too slow . i 'm moving too fast and now they think i 'm going without them . i stepped on someone 's hat . i dressed that one first , and this one wanted to go first . this one is screaming at me . this one is going for a time out .
i can read his books or watch videos , but being there , hearing him talk about the importance of compassion and humanity , was incredible . it is not likely to be an experience i will ever have again . also , he was really funny he told jokes and laughed at them . he really is a great human being .
as , i said we will be offering prizes . the first prize is for images from the store . the nd prize is only if you submit a project using one of our images along with the challenge . if you do so , then you will be eligible to win image from our store and a guest design team spot .
it was just so nice to pick out a top in a pattern and color that i liked , and have it fit and look good on me . at the same time , i realized that most people probably take this for granted . this is how they shop all the time but for me , it was a fresh joy .
so what 's going on in my head at this hour i have to admit that just now its mostly work related . not surprising i suppose , as its all still fairly new , but this new part time job does seem to have taken over my entire life . i 'm assuming the work life balance bit will level out soon
my favorite room is always the one i just finished . i do n't know if it 's relief that it 's finally done , or if each just gets better than the last . i guess if i had to choose , it 'd be my kid 's rooms because of the joy they get from having their own fun spaces .
i feel like i kind of popped while in hawaii . the picture was actually at the beginning of our trip . at the beginning of the trip i looked like i may have just eaten too much , but by the end i think i actually was starting to look pregnant . i need to write about this pregnancy . soon .
this year i am having to focus a bit harder on my job just to keep up and since that is what is paying the attorney fees and bills right now that is where i am putting my focus . even though i know for a fact that i am more productive and happier when i get out and move my body .
this little dip into discernment can and should be applied to all areas of our lives . faith . family . friends . there s not enough real truth seeking going on these days and it has led to a tragic loss of wisdom . let s all change that . today is your chance to effect the future beginning with you .
i think it s also getting a better picture of these very violent past events . we d like to find out more about the scope of those events . we have a lot of old data from past events that s on paper in newspapers and so on and we re busy trying to find ways to turn it into digital .
hope you all had a great holiday season and a happy new year . i do n't know about anyone else , but by the time new years day arrives , i am so over the holiday season . all i want to do is to take down all the decorations i was dying to put up only a few weeks before .
the girls may not qualify as my friends , but they do know me as well as if not better than my closest friends . they may know a lot of truths about their dad that they wish they did n't , but it actually got easier for them once they did understand that it really was n't them , but him .
what i found interesting was that each week during march i moved between to units per week . this is all without any kind of advertising on my part . i ve just let slip drive sit there and do its thing . if i had tried to push it , i wonder what kind of numbers i would have seen then .
every may i set myself a challenge to take a new photo each day , however this year will be slightly different , in that i will try to publish a photo a day rather than to take a photo a day . ultimately it is hard as a shift worker to come up with a picture after working a hour shift .
think of your life as a marriage to yourself . right now , i 've fallen out of love with me , and i 'm thinking about divorce . perhaps i should try a trial separation . i have this overwhelming sense that it 's time for me to go , and that i 'll never find myself stuck where i am .
and one can not insert three ones into one and call it one . this is absurd . it is not a mystery why it can not be done it is as clear as it could be . in imagination it would then be four as i said earlier for three to be in one which would really then add up to four
i think if we ever got the funding support , people would be blown out by what we would find . and i have another possibility now this is something i do nt know exactly quite how to play this , but i have some connections with the media for possibly doing some documentaries on it . there s some strong interest .
fabric fast becoming bradford s cultural engine room they list events , provide courses , give artists a leg up and seek out new and exciting talent and much , much more . make sure you take a look at what s on offer if you want to make , see or experience art in bradford , fabric must be your first call
as i got older and became a writer , i knew i wanted to write about it . but i did n't trust myself to write a historical novel or a literary novel i 'm not a particular fan of either genre as a reader , and i 'm a big believer that you should write the kind of book you love .
i 've learned never to make a promise i ca n't keep . if i make a promise to you , you can bet your life on me keeping it . a long time ago , i broke more promises than i can count , and i still remember the look in the eyes of those i let down . never again .
my grandmother died of breast cancer before she was years old . i was very young when she died and barely remember her . i did not want that for my baby girl or my two boys . i am so grateful for the medical technology that is currently available to give me the peace of mind to know that all is well .
lee said , a majority of players who come here will want to play professional baseball and we want to make sure that when they enter professional baseball they have the best possible chance of being successful . it is not just about saying that hey , i played professional baseball , it s about giving the players a chance to be successful .
how did christmas get to be only a week away we still do n't have our tree or any decorations up i would have been blogging about everything i 've been doing for the last couple of weeks mainly crafting of presents and eating of christmas dinners but i 've been too busy doing it all i 've started to feel rather stressed .
peter spent the rest of the weekend in our apartment . we continued to have sex several times after my first . we had a good sexual chemistry and i felt comfortable with him . i did not feel self conscious and i knew that this was not a relationship . when he asked me why i chose him , i simply said ,
my wife and i did a little fishing tuesday evening and ended up catching fish altogether . my kids did nt fish , but they were nearby throwing things in the water and making way too much noise . here is my take on what one of the fish my wife caught was probably thinking before , during , and after being caught .
i 'm not entirely happy with how this project turned out , as i mentioned last post , i put a lot of thought into projects for the people i knit for . but what counts in the end is that they keep his hands warm in the moments when i am not there . i 'll be sending these off to him tomorrow
it was ten days before he died , so i got to see him before he really curled his toes over the edge , thank god . we 'd spent weeks together in november just father , mother and daughter and it was such a gift , i think it 's helped me get through all the other shit over the past months .
on my wall upstairs it says follow your heart and that is what i am doing . not just in regards to this new relationship but in other areas too . i know i want to settle down properly , be creative , be who i am , get my masters , have a career but along that journey i also want children .
my mom has been buttering me up to come help her with some house projects . she 's even offering free lunch and gas if i come over sunday , which naturally has me really worried about what she wants me to do of course i 'll go , if only so i can mention it when the time comes to sand my secretary
indeed , looking stylish while still feeling comfortable is quite difficult to achieve . but here at velvet we have gathered a few celebrity styles to give you a glimpse of how you can dress to impress while on a long , tiring journey . if you follow our favorite stars high fashion sense , you ca nt go wrong on your next trip
i made a visual for her with a sticker reward system . we practiced at home standing still , with me on one side and renee on the other . we talked about it in the evening before bed and right before we went to school . she can tell you the rules but following them when the time comes is the problem .
some things are meant to be done in secret so that only the lord , who knows the heart , will see why we have done them . other things are meant to be shared with all who will listen so that they will know him , too . but all things are a matter of the heart and to whom it belongs .
i 've seen the faith you have had during those very dark august days when just putting on a jersey did n't seem possible . i worked some miracles to get you back for another year in your very expensive private school . everyone who knew your situation , even your own parents , were amazed that you could believe the unseen so clearly
i often hear people say , no one would want to hear about my boring life , but is that true is any life so boring that it could not be possibly written in such a way to make it interesting the way i see it , it 's not so much the content of the life but how well it is written .
in large skillet over medium high heat add the oil and then brown the ground beef , about minutes . add the onion and green pepper and cook another minutes , until the vegetables start to get tender . stir in the steak sauce and beef stock , season with salt and pepper , bring up to a bubble and cook about minutes .
although it seems like you ll be able to remember everything , unless you keep a diary or log of your activities and learning , you will probably forget valuable information that you need for your final report . keeping note of important dates such as when you started and finished your placement will also help you with job applications after you graduate .
the challenge is half way done , and i do nt really want to talk about today s class other than it was a minute yin class , and it went alright . i would rather talk about my yoga gear which makes me really happy , and do a little check in to see what physical progress has been made so far .
we hope you had a wonderful time with your loved ones this christmas . there are hundreds of thousands of south african emigrants who were most likely far from family and friends . i can tell you from my own experience that this is something you never get used to . not being able to see family and friends at a snap decision .
christmas is fast approaching choose from a variety of themes to make is extra fun . lots of ideas in this post to decorate your home this holiday in beautiful theme colors . pick a color that describes your family 's personality and style . you are sure to enjoy designing , displaying and showing your creativity have an amazing christmas this year o
i know there are people who are down on new year s resolutions for various reasons , but i am of the opinion that they can be a huge help to us as we strive to become more like jesus in the different aspects of our lives . here are some reasons why i think this with regard to spiritual resolutions in particular .
i am starting again on my training . i beat a personal record this past week on my running i ran a mile in . that is slow for most , but a really exciting record for me i was super excited about that . i would like to get my overall miles done in less than minutes . i am so close .
this could happen in storm , natural disaster , or economic depression . i feel that we are blessed with time to prepare , and advanced technology . there are many options available today , that were not available during the great depression . if you still have a home your options will be different than if you do nt have a home .
and that s just one of the things that is cool about working with god . sure , i could push people to go it my way and do a covenant just like mine . but , it s not about my way . it s about his way . he is really the one asking , are us gon na go my way
he had fallen asleep or so we assume , he was awake when we found him in my bed , under the covers i had n't made my bed . i had been in my room at least four times but never checked under the covers . i was more thinking he was just hiding from me so i checked his hiding places .
my mother is years old , and for the first time this month , i have felt a hug from her unlike any i ve ever experienced before . same goes for my husband . i ve started receiving hugs from him that not only remind me of how much he loves me , they tell me he does nt want to let go .
when someone commented on my weight loss and i told them that it was n't a good thing and i hoped i would n't be this weight this time next year and that i was so exhausted that i could barely get out of bed , they said oh no you do n't want to put that weight back on , do n't say that
my colleagues tell me that september october is a time when there is rain , though not as much as the semi torrential rain that we have witnessed for the past couple of days . the official rainy season is actually around june july , so when we get cats and dogs rain in short starts like this , i can only wonder one thing
thus , from its operation in us , we see that this gift is a supernatural tool that the holy spirit uses to permit our very common and otherwise very limited human nature to participate in bringing forth god s kingdom without requiring the human effort and prayer talent required to achieve the same level of prayer and communion with the father s heart .
sharing my passion with like minded individuals does indeed increase my happiness . to listen to your feedback , an opportunity to interact with you through questions , and just general friendly banter online has become such a highlight in my life . let me put it this way , if the net went away overnight , i 'd be at a total loss .
i know , i know , last week i said be vague , but i was talking about different things . when you are promising something , be vague so that they re happy , but they do nt have any specific image to attach to . be vague when you re talking about you . be specific when you are talking about them .
i have n't seen the complete exhibit on both floors yet , it is still being set up but what i have seen is amazing you will love the variety of subjects , use of color , and expertise that all the artists bring to this beautiful art center . if you live anywhere in the midwest , please put this on your calendar .
i 've never been a big black friday shopper only managed to really go once and it was n't my thing . so i was extremely happy to just sit at home decorating the house with christmas tunes in the background . and i still managed to get some great deals for gifts because i did a lot of my shopping this year online .
i exhibit these stages when the children are away , see below if you fancy an insight into the times when they are here and i think i do okay , even if i do say so myself , when they are around to be as normal as i can be . do n't laugh i can be normal the stages look something like this
overall , i really liked this book and i expect that my younger sister who is just learning to sew will attempt to permanently borrow it from me next time she visits if you 've just got your first sewing machine or want to branch out a bit from just sewing straight lines all the time , this may be the book for you .
there were moments throughout the day , i could nt just sit there and relax i should be doing something , right spend this fee time wisely throw in a yoga session , wash the windows , start christmas shopping , write letters to relatives who do nt email , find someone so i am not alone . and then it passed . quickly .
for those of us who have been around a while that is exactly what we are doing . she would kick our hide if we stopped doing what we had been taught just because the season ended . and because we are doing what we were told we are still shocking ourselves at times with the results . hence the over enthusiastic posting at times
i could be totally wrong , but freedom on any level , on any subject is anything but free . freedom is a responsibility that all of us have to shoulder . young and old alike . lets act like we know this is true and see where we go , what we choose and how we teach that choice has consequence . always .
and , he added , we ll look like such heroes that nobody will care anyway . she actually smiled through red , misty eyes and turned to face him again as he drove on . she had nt paid great attention to where he was driving and suddenly noticed they were in the parking lot to the mall . what are we doing here
so , no fat talk for sounds like a great goal to me . i 'm still working on a theme for the year , but i think i should make the ban on fat talk a general goal for me for life . i want to keep up with my healthy eating changes and exercise without the increased negative body focus it brings .
i 've really come to appreciate monday in the last two weeks . i usually work on tuesday and wednesday , have pre school co op on thursday and then the weekend starts sunday has become a work day ... so by monday i 'm thrilled to relax , clean up , spend time with the kids and re charge for the week ahead .
i just got this book in the mail a few days ago , and it has already made some rounds through my school age readers . they love it when books come that are written to their age level . let 's face it , though , there are many books out there that are collections of bible stories . what sets this one apart
i am sorry that this picture does n't do the dish justice either . we have had many rainy and overcast days , and since we only have one window glass door it was difficult getting any good photos . rest assured though , i am sure to make this again , and next time i will be putting my own spin on things .
if any ministry is going to succeed , it is vital to learn how to work as a team . jeffery lay in his book , top gun on wall street , says we do nt send anyone , anywhere . we all go together . lay was a top gun pilot who transferred the leadership skills learned from the military into the business world .
do nt worry , i am a strong person . i will come out of this and get my shit together , but for now i really need to focus on getting real with myself . i have to fix me before i destroy anything or anyone else . i need to figure out why i feel the need to control people into loving me .
i got ta say this is a hard one to review . there is so much to discuss but it would give the movie away . so i shall try my best . first off , the film is a typical slasher flick with five friends in a remote area that encounter non human creatures that try to kill them , or so you would think
so , that 's the second thing about me . if you want to come over , let me know , and we 'll talk about it , and maybe i 'll let you in if a messy house does n't freak you out . do n't pretend but if you want , and you 're ok with it , i 'll let you in .
my mom s journey with cancer has had its moments of fear and hope as she went into surgery that was possibly to take her life , though might have given her longer life then came out , after exploratory surgery said it could nt be done . she has decided to just let it be and enjoy life for as long as she can .
but to get to the point at long last often when a young player first breaks into the first team and plays well , i believe we get a glimpse , not of what the guy is capable of producing every match thereafter , but what level he might be able to reach in a few years with luck , hard work and careful guidance .
it 's very important to me that my children know god 's word , not just what they 've heard me say , or heard in church , but that they know it because they are very familiar with it from reading it day in and day out . i know how that affects each day for me , and i want that for them .
she also says good job to us . she will ask me to draw something and when i do she will say , good job mom . even if it was a terrible drawing . she does this for lots of things like singing a song or playing a song on the piano , or kicking a ball , or making her some food item .
i do n't do this for recognition or fame . i do not receive either at school . we usually just hear about what we need to do better . i do this because i believe in kids . i want to teach them . i want to be around them . i want to show them love and give them a positive role model .
and for those who have reached out personally those of you who went to great lengths to figure out how to communicate with me sorry it was so hard i will seriously consider posting an email address . your stories inspire me and through sharing you have reminded me that none of us are alone in our journey blessings to you , i am truly touched
as many of y' all already know , i just adore anything with animal prints so i chose a leopard print hanging flower ball and plant pick . when it arrived , i was blown away by how neat and beautiful these items truly are each piece is hand made to order , and such a neat and unique gift for any one , including yourself
also , it 's really crazy to me that our responsibility is still even with insurance . i feel like it 's a testament to the fact that something about the state of medical care in our country needs to be changed . i do n't have the right answers , but i only know that it does n't seem to be working right now .
after i talked to mum i tried to phone dad , but he was busy at work , and did nt seem that interested in talking . he s with his first love , his job , and i m sure it s much more interesting . so we just said our hellos , and chatted for a few minutes , and then hung up .
so now that we re about to begin , you re probably asking , what are we going to do , and how are we going to do it well , we re going to give you everything you need to make a body change through a series of elegant and effective changes based on hard science that will stick with you for your life .
i read a lot of jacqueline wilson to my partner s daughter which she thoroughly enjoyed . but i also read her the beginning of great expectations and i saw her eyes grow wide . she was totally hooked . with young children so much depends on the adult and whether they transfer their love of story and whether they can bring stories to life .
deadline for posting your projects , using inlinkz , is noon central time on friday , september , . we will announce the winner of the stamp set and the new top mouse award winners when the new sketch challenge is posted on saturday , september . please use a direct link to your project and feel free to enter as many times as you like
in other news , the internet is still awesome . i found a place where you can learn how to write computer code for free , which is kind of interesting and fun . i tend to race through the exercises , but i think i need to set up a way of revising and actually remembering things once i 've ' learned ' them .
these went into my etsy shop and have sold already . the one on the left was sold for comic relief . i really enjoyed doing them and must make a point of doing more regularly . i 'm going to try and fit in doing another this week and the money will go to red cross to help with the terrible tragedy in japan .
most of all , god 's really been showing me the importance of getting up early before my kids so that i can have a few precious moments of reading his word while sipping my coffee . i 've got ta enjoy it while i can because with baby boy on the way , it 's going to be back to getting it when i can
and now i cry because i do n't know how to help him . i do n't know how to explain to him that it 's not going to be painful , to tell him that if he goes just one time in a day he wo n't have the issues that he has . that the other kids wo n't make fun of him .
and yay , probably the worst possible way of hiding a body when your husband comes home , make sure not to just leave the body in the empty attic where no one even goes , and do drag it across the hallway where it could be very visible if he happened to walk past at the wrong time . you re so smart , julia
so i guess i , too , would love to share these moments with my little guy . it s not so much that i long for him to one day be a chef although i d support him if he wanted to be one . it s more about the time we spend together laughing and getting to know each at a deeper level .
i do nt think i can learn this lesson though , when i m having fun or doing some project i believe in , i forget about everything , so at that moment i do nt care if my clothes get ruined , if i loose my bag , anything can happen and i just get carried away with the moment like there s no tomorrow
the film taught me how sensitive you have to be to the material and make sure that you are expressing the characters fairly and not presenting them in a negative or false light . it was particularly hard to distance myself from the interviews as i obviously had strong emotions attached to my grandparents and knew how much these people meant to them and me .
everybody at the park came over in a panic . we massaged annie 's hip for a few minutes and she eventually put weight on it and we walked slowly back to the car . i felt bad for her she is almost now and has a hard time getting over injuries . having her mom fall on her probably was scary as hell too .
fill you decorating bags and get all your tips ready to decorate with tip on the blue frosting , begin piping the frosting around the outer edge of the cupcake . continue until all but the mouth is covered . you can add more frosting if you want to build up his fur in certain areas , or to give him more of a shape .
where the difficulty comes in is when you have a story , such as a young adult coming of age novel , that is set in average town , usa because the characters are n't the type to travel the world , or ca n't even if they want to and maybe that 's part of their internal conflict . everything they experience is local .
we are finally getting settled in . the kids have been enjoying their weekly classical conversations , we 've found a few homeschool groups to plug into and we 've made some real connections and friendships . we found out that one of our homeschool family buddies lives only a block away from us , so we 've been able to visit with them quite often
combine the first ingredients in a medium bowl . spread cheese mixture over pizza crust , leaving a inch border around the edge . sprinkle with basil and next ingredients basil through garlic powder . arrange plum tomato slices in a single layer on top . place pizza on baking sheet . bake at for minutes . remove pizza to cutting board cut into slices .
it 's been a pretty stressful few weeks and i am just so nervous and so scared . i really wish i had a time machine and i could just fast forward to a time in the future when all is well and i have a healthy little full term baby in my arms . please keep your fingers crossed for me on thursday and friday
a couple years ago , a friend offered to hold a little class for a handful of us who were interested in making soap . the first thing she told us was that no one under was allowed to be in the class or wandering within our work area . i 've kept that as a rule . another couple rules that i never break are
there are about finished tie dye sitting in my coat closet , but there 's no room left for more there just has to be a place to put more of these things lucky for me , my craft room closet should be able to hold a few , because i plan to do a bunch more while i have the time away from school .
that series is finished for now , but i may pick it up again in the future . i set it up for a spin off series . i do nt have any plans for it as the moment , but i really loved that world and there may come a time in the future i might want to play a bit more in it .
. connections were made to me , that s the real value of a tweetup connecting with folks in real time . business cards were flying everywhere that was one of the intentions when we came up with this idea last year , for some like minded folks to come together and share . now we just need a few more cool folks to come out
what he had was egg , butter , half pot of cream cheese , milk and chocolate chips . i thought that half a pot of finland did not amount to a yogurt , so my first idea was to make mini muffins , but when we went to look for patterns , these were the ones in sight , and of course you chose .
now , for the real reason why i m writing this post i finally finished darkfever it was pretty good but i do nt think i ll continue the series . i ll write a review on it whenever school is done . i am still reading city of fallen angels and i already have the next book picked out to read after that one .
to be fair , the amount of work and time required to fully understand someone is significant who has the time to do this most people already have trouble understanding themselves , much less immerse themselves in someone else s life for the purpose of some sort of deeper understanding especially if that person is a stranger and if your parents have warned you against him .
i hope this helps if you have any questions or you need something to be a little clearer leave a comment or send an email . like i said , i 'm still learning all of this stuff . and at first , it is really confusing . but the more you play around with things , the easier it gets really so give it a try
the fact of jesus christ is the eternal message of the bible . it is the story of life , peace , eternity , and heaven . the bible has no hidden purpose . it has no need for special interpretation . it has a single , clear , bold message for every living being the message of christ and his offer of peace with god .
relight rule no . take the blame are you both ready to hold your hands up to the part you played in your relationship breaking up if yes , that 's an excellent sign that you realise it 's a two way street when relationships end . use this new , responsible attitude that you both have to work out how you can do things differently .
halloween is still a ways off . but for the last couple months i 've been eating , sleeping and breathing halloween do n't get me wrong , i love it it just kind of throws me off from the real world calendar . heck , we have n't even had the fourth of july yet and i 'm surrounded by all things dark and spooky .
i thought that this was the future for me and the small company that i had started in , but life had other plans for me and i was nt able to continue with my business . the idea never left me and i still dreamed about doing this one day and i would continually dream up things that i wanted to do for my business .
it 's a rainy day here . i have been working on school work most of the afternoon . i am a bit tired of looking at my computer screen , so i am not about to draw in photoshop today . i kind of feel like being lazy and hanging on the couch . not sure yet , if that is what i will do .
new year 's is upon us , and of course so is another feast . in my family you ' go big or go home ' as the americans say and as we have n't cooked a big meal ourselves yet all of christmas we are taking over new year 's instead with a big turkey dinner england style which is tradition here for this holiday .
i am scared of moving on however as again it will be a new job after two years the time i have been in my present role . and again i ll have to explain to friends and family why i am moving again , and think up some reason to tell companies i interview at as to why i am looking for a new job .
great news i broke away from those two and i m on another car . i had no choice it was that or catch another train . now the bad part to this besides getting trapped by more happy people is i have no idea where to get off . i m assuming its dupont circle . if i m wrong im really in deep shit .
work still has the ability to make me anxious . i still wake up in the middle of the night thinking dark thoughts about my experiences of the past three years . then i tell myself i 've been lucky , look at all the people working in horrible jobs on poverty wages . all the people with no hope trying to survive on poverty benefits .
hubby is fortunate to work in an industry , and for a company , that has places all over the world , as well as in many states that he could transfer to , or change companies , so we 've been keeping our eye out , and praying like crazy that god will open up an opportunity for us that we are suppose to take .
this week it is my turn to host and i have chosen the theme ' favourite things ' , so all you need to do is add one or more of your favourite things to your creations . the dt have made some gorgeous cards for your inspiration so if you could drop by and give them some love i am sure it would be appreciated .
she is a cute and lovely girl . but she is a little bit shy when she meets someone for the first time . but , when you have already been able to get along with her , you will find out that she is a lovely girl . i have not met her personally but that s what i think when i watch this program .
we owe life itself to all the mothers who walk with life hand in hand and then literally carry life the last nigh miles of the race that our lives as individuals would not have been able to finish had a mother not stepped up to be the holy savior of us when we could not carry on , during the hardest leg of a spiritual run
prayer jesus , you did not come to be right . you did nt even have to be born or die for me . you came to serve . help me to see that pouring oil is another way to emulate you a little more . please clean out pride from my heart and replace it with the desire to honor you above myself . amen .
what i do nt get is why everyone seems to think there is a universal right or wrong when it comes to their favorite genre and the genres they do nt like . sorry , but try as you might , no one can prove that anything sucks . we might think it sucks , but if someone else loves it , who is right who wins
i m not sure how it s different from other dramas this year maybe i could say it s a very small drama . i did nt really try to throw any tricks as a director either , i feel tricks are for those who lack heart in their storytelling . i just tried to tell a really honest story that meant a lot to me .

there were two cute dogs at the vineyard i think our teachers and the owner were all bothered of us paying more attention to the dogs than the information he was giving for us about making wine d one of the italian teachers asked us we have never seen a dog before , or what was the reason for everyone going crazy about them , haha .
that world the world of the child becoming an adult is a really interesting one , i think . it manages to bring with it a lot of the wonder of childhood , but that wonder is combined with new forces , many dark and confusing . it is a time when you are trying on the you of the future and seeing how it fits .
miss and i were a little nervous about the class but we were quickly made to feel at ease by the friendly teacher . we were shocked to see the sample cupcakes that we were going to make , they looked so complicated the teacher announced that we would be making designs in the next two hours these samples on the right are what we gasped at
i only have a few shots of my sister , because my other sister had my camera to take photos and it was almost as though she was waiting for her to have a weird look on her face to snap . so i 'm only showing you the photos that wo n't get me a phone call that starts um , you better take those down
i know you will be stunned to find out the man on the other end was none to pleasant . i tell him my name and the case number and he says , nope nothing . i said , but there has to be something because you called me at my number and used my name . he insist there is nothing . ok , fine .
no one will ever understand why i fell hard for him until i relate our love story , not until i share what made me fall for him and what were the simple things that he had done that made so much impact to me . after all , i have only myself as witness to all those sweet nothings that brought me a whole bliss .
works great for drop cookies also works well filling mini muffin cups without making a mess . once again , for both uses , this scoop creates uniform measures of the item for even and consistent baking . here 's a waist friendly really , i 'm not kidding chocolate peanut butter drop cookie recipe if you want to give a small ice cream scoop a try
q many of my readers are younger , in high school or college , but you and i discussed how hard those first few romantic relationships can be mine sure as hell were . can you share some wisdom about teenage college age relationships and what those readers will find beneficial from your book even if they do n't necessarily think their partner is cheating on them
sarah was promised a child , but instead of waiting on god 's timing she took matters into her own hands . because of her taking control of the situation we have and will continue to have conflict in the middle east and beyond between these two groups . how much different would the world be today had sarah quietly waited on god to fulfill his promise
while it 's so very sweet that she is always within three feet of me , she 's very little and quiet so she frequently gets stepped on . i 'm not used to having a shadow none of the kiddos ever followed me around like this unless i was trying to use the bathroom by myself . this devoted behavior has taken some getting used to .
i hope this post finds you all in good health and enjoying the joys of the season . do n't forget to take the time to pray for those less fortunate , or those who may be spending this christmas alone without a loved one , for the first time . every day truly is a gift and we need to purpose not to take that for granted
a basic miso soup is very easy and perfect for cold weather like we are having today . you need a cup of boiling water , some miso paste and about minutes to spare . you can do it the proper way , but that takes a very long time , and it s not really worth it if you are cooking for one or two people .
but at this point that does nt matter . the goal for the first draft is to get your ideas down on paper . see the story beyond your initial thoughts and then figure out what needs to be brought up and what needs to be knocked down . and i have a feeling a lot in and can be thrown out . but that s ok .
i do nt know what the hell it is but there s something about the idea of going home with a y.o that makes me think this is nt right . and then maybe i start to think about what they were doing six years ago and what i was and i nearly want to pat them on the head and say that s nice , dear .
can you look in a mirror and be ok with what is looking back at you if you are not applying your values in an honest and consistent manner , the answer would be no . integrity is something you have to exhibit all the time . you can not have integrity day , not exhibit it the next day , and expect people to trust you .
did nt matter . the couple sitting next to him were paying attention . i heard them talking about how it had been minutes since he left . the wife was going to check on the status of the flight it was about at that point , and no plane had arrived , and her husband told her to mention the bag abandoner to the gate agent .
life need not be so black and white , right and wrong . kids are people , real humans with real thoughts and real ideas and here 's a news flash ... sometimes they just know better than us parents about what 's good and right for themselves , even if they make choices that we do n't like you really can be okay with it , really
so she stepped aside and gave katie the space that she needed . she allowed her to be angry if she needed to be she allowed her to feel whatever she needed to feel she allowed her to sort it all out for herself she gave her as much time and space as she needed . and today , it 's clear that she did everything right .
now , many of you probably do n't understand why i am so amazed by this because you know emily and she 's like this all of the time . but , i have been pretty worried for the past couple weeks because she has cried every morning not wanting to go to school it has totally stressed me out . i have been on pins and needles
today is also our year wedding anniversary . it 's hard to believe six years has already passed since we first married . it 's also our official year mark our wedding date was the four year anniversary of our first date . ten years is crazy for me to think , but i also could n't imagine my life without my husband . he 's amazing .
no , i m really ok being by myself . but am i supposed to become happy knowing no one loves me i m not talking family love , i m talking intimate love . the love i do nt have . how do i become content with that how do i accept that i just want to be special to someone who is special to me .
it breaks my heart that his mind goes there to . i wish i could be the only crazy one and he could just live in a life of bliss where you get to raise all of your children and you never worry about them leaving you before you leave them . i wish i did n't know that either but i wish he did n't more .
okay , not totally free , shipping and handling will still apply , but at just and some change , this is still a chance you do n't want to miss out on to make it easy , i 've set up a rafflecopter giveaway and tried to give you plenty of extra entries , i will close the giveaway on april st . good luck to all
because , obviously , making things up was not a proper job as far as the younger version of me was concerned , i spent the greater part of my childhood believing i was going to be a journalist when i grew up . it was either that or go into advertising copy writing and here i refer you to my earlier point about making things up .
this past week i 've struggled with these thoughts and other inner struggles . and frankly , i 'm tired . strike that , i 'm exhausted . i 've run out of steam to the point where i just want to come home and cry . not only am i fighting with myself , but physically i am tired from ish hours a day of work .
we can hit degrees below zero which is no heat , but we ca nt go any further after that . there is no such thing as cold . cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat . we can not measure cold . heat is energy cold is not the opposite of heat , sir , just the absence of it .
you know where to go for the best deals and where to go for the bet deals on the items that some people simply buy all at the same place for saving time and money . are you that you can find great discount deals online that you can also find items and getting good products in good price is just another part of your daily deals .
i want a proper school , sir , to teach reading and writing , and most of all thinking , sir , so people can find what they re good at , because someone doing what they really like is always an asset to any country , and too often people never find out until it s too late . from i shall wear midnight by terry pratchett
you know , the most profound messages usually come from children . they do nt use big , complicated words , but what they say will have you thinking well after the conversation . do nt fake it , people . keep it simple . allow the characters actions and their decisions within the story to determine whether they are smart . show , do nt tell .
what are the terms under which the world can offer peace the peace that the world gives comes with fear . we must have anxiety , caution , and a bit of trouble in our hearts , because we know that peace in this world is short lived . it is fragile , and can only last as long as the interests of the powerful are met .
i know all boys are different but my boys love so deeply . i treasure this . i know that in the years to come the love that i get to have all to myself will go to another wonderful woman . and while i know that is the way it is to be i will be sad when those kisses and hugs are not all mine .
prayer lord , it is often hard for us to believe that your plan for us is really the best or even that it is good often , your plan seems confusing and painful . let us trust in your character , and your promise , that your plan for us to for good and to give us life and a future in jesus name , amen .
if your agent is showing the house to a potential buyer , find something to do so you are not at home . a buyer wo nt feel as comfortable if you are there . with you in the immediate picture , it will be harder for potential buyers to imagine themselves living in the home . this could have an end result of losing that buyer .
there s a prayer that gets used at aa and na workshops sometimes . it goes like this god , please set aside everything i think i know about myself , the twelve steps , this book , the meetings , my disease , and you so i may have an open mind and a new experience with all these things . let me see the truth .
very few people knew what was going on , and i apologize to all of my wonderful friends , but we made a decision early on to keep all of the details private until we had answers . so private that my own mother , who i tell everything to , was just recently informed . to read about how it all went down you can go here
i do have sister but she was nt my inspiration for the dynamic we are years apart and very different . megan and morgan are patterned from my best friend . we have been friends for over years and we have their same relationship . where one of us has a weakness , it is the other strength and we can play off each other the same way
what should i get for mom i just need one more little gift for my brother . a gift for the boss . at the surface , it may seem commercial and perhaps it 's your least favorite part of the holidays . but thinking about everyone but yourself for a week or two ca n't be a bad thing . not a bad thing at all .
this post is not going to give you a ' quick fix ' nor is it meant to be a lecture to make anyone feel bad guilty etc . there are a few tips but more importantly i have three inspirational stories to share with you , to help kick start you on a healthier path , one that i hope you continue on , well past january
that 's the end of the entries in my diary on this , the last day of curfew . when i look back now and try to remember how i felt at that point , the impression i have is one of holding my breath for a very long time . as i said before , the days of curfew had begun to feel relatively safe and secure .
if i read a fiction book , someone has to recommend it to me and it has to be awesome . the human stain falls into this category and after reading that , i do nt know how to find something to top it . i m sure there s more great work out there , i m just too lazy . if you have suggestions , please share
the question of the month , what are you doing , or what did you do , for national volunteer appreciation week large events , small events , many words of appreciation or few words of appreciation , it s hard to know , in my opinion , what is the correct thing to do . how do we ensure that every volunteer knows how much we appreciate them
you have keep getting up every time you get knocked down and come back at it with everything you have , even when you do nt want to . if you will choose it , if you will commit , pursue , and follow through , those prison walls will come down and you will create for yourself the life you have had hoped fate would hand you .
they had a decent amount of savings , but now they are in serious trouble . dave is trying to get back into work , but his field property is even more badly hit in spain than in ireland . they have not paid their , a month mortgage since amy vanished and now the bank have warned them they are in real danger of losing their house .
i want to qualify for boston i never thought i would say that , and i know it s going to be hard work and will require a lot of sacrifice on my part but i feel i m ready to step back into the shoes of a marathon runner albeit slowly , but i m going to step into them . one step at a time , right
i hope that when you discover a charming village , new restaurant , gorgeous hotel , unique shop , great value wine or anything else worthwhile , you 'll share the names with us . if you hear about an upcoming event that sounds like fun an art show , concert , dance performance , truffle festival , whatever please let me know so i can post it .
he loves god , is nice to people and takes really good care of his family . he gets very little time to himself and helps me with the kids every day . i do nt always say thanks , but i m extremely grateful . as i get older , i see more and more that this is nt the norm . he s a good one .
i wrote about the beautiful cover last friday , when i checked this book out of the library . at that time i had read only the first paragraph . the book did n't go in the direction i expected , though it held my attention and kept pulling me from page to page . i came away from my reading feeling pessimistic about the future of iraq .
you ll see , i responded . i will succeed . i will go one year , without spending i am wondering if her total lack of support is a sort of reverse psychology move . she tells me there is no way i can do this , so i feel the need to prove her wrong . more days to go . i can totally do this .
i had a job interview recently . it 's been many years since i last interviewed , so it was strange for me . it was also on the national tornado alert day , so in the middle of my interview , we walked down into the parking garage and stood there for a moment . yep , now i know what to do if i worked there .
avenue , but it was nt quite what i expected . i have to be honest , for about the first half of the book , it was annoying me beyond all belief , however i kept at it because i hate not finishing books , and i also like to hold out hope that things will suddenly get much better , which they did . around about chapter
so the first challenge on the list was a wish list this list grew over the course of a year , i am not usually a person who wants things so badly that it 's all they can think about . worse , i forget most things i ever wanted before they even reach an imaginary list so it took me some thinking to come up with these xd
here is my sample for fabulous dogs . it 's such a fun set . i could n't resist using the sentiment for a background for this little cutie who is just sitting in the grass . i colored her up the best i could and made sure to get her little pink tongue hanging out of her mouth . what kind of dog do you think she is
we 've had some extra family staying with us lately so it 's been great to be able to prepare meals for everyone and then all sit down together to eat . i know they enjoy it and i feel good at having shown love through food . such a nice thing . i 've even been cooking lunches on the weekends , something i never usually did .
they never physically abused me but i had enough of the emotional abuse , especially from my father . my dad was always very critical , demeaning , cold . he 'd often make fun of me , my brothers did this too a lot , and my mom would laugh along with them , treating me like my thoughts and feelings were silly , stupid , ridiculous .
now remember what you are actually doing at work . most student part time work is customer service based . congratulations , you little social networker what you are practicing every shift shows you have excellent communication skills . in the real world of work , these will be essential all the time . you will be able to build relationships with clients and workers effectively and easily .
one of the best things we can do is practice the habits that lead to more happiness like showing gratitude . when you feel happy and confident , you re going to be able to take risks , and be able to try to learn new things and feel good about those experiences . and then allow yourself to share the love and gratitude you have with others .
so what do you do to combat that dry desert feel to your life how do you restore a new normal how can you fell anywhere close to normal again when there are periods of your life that seem like complete chaos the holy spirit has been really digging up some ground in my heart and showing me . you have to start over . start looking for joy
i was thinking in particular about the questions and then i thought of my favorite questions i like to ask guys when i m out on a first date . steve s questions are fine , but i think some of my questions give me insight into what the guy is about and does nt feel as intense as , well what do you think about marriage and kids
but , somehow , in one weekend we managed to decorate the room , clean things up , make my lesson plan to start the week , make a quick emergency quick to the doctors , and still go to the mountains for a second trip . when i write it all down i start to wonder what the hell we were thinking , but we got it done
yes , you all read that correctly . i am officially back on the writing wagon that same wagon i have been trying to climb back on for the past two months . however introducing my new daughter to the world was a much more important job . but now that she is sleeping like a baby , it means that i can get a little writing work done
i have especially done a lot of questioning in the last month with two deaths in the family one a great aunt and the most recent passing being my grandfather . death is a teacher . it offers all of us a time to celebrate a loved ones life and a time to question what we are up to in our own lives and make changes if necessary .
if you would 've told me over years ago we would n't be together , i would 've laughed myself silly . for whatever the reasons are , how it broke down , whose fault it was , i 'll never truly know . i was too busy raising two children for the last of them . they 're my world and my focus of the time now .
today i hung out with my dad and step mom , we ate great food and went to see ' a single man ' , directed by tom ford . they thought it was a little depressing , but i thought it was beautiful . the lighting especially was very inventive , and the guys were gorgeous and oh so well dressed . you should go see it .
inside the city limits , you can call the city animal shelter but if you are located outside the city limits , there is really no one to call for help . rogers county does not have an animal shelter . this problem is left to volunteer organizations dedicated to helping abandoned and abused animals . these organizations work off of money from their own pockets and donations .
first , let 's talk about fear . i know the word is being used in a somewhat casual sense here but for me at that school there was a more significant depth to that word than i 'm afraid it might rain . more like i 'm afraid to hold this grenade with the pin out when the spoon looks like it might not be completely engaged .
in other news i have had a rather more open conversation with my dad and it seems like there is a chance for us to meet in the coming months i 'm really not sure this has fully hit me yet , i was over joyed to even be talking about ' me ' and to know that i could soon be seeing my parents is just overwhelming .
we re all different , we all hold different views and we all have a human right to continue to do so . those who want to come together in this way and show a strength of community and purpose go in peace . and hope . those who want to remember in their own way , or even not at all go in peace . and hope .
i 'm in hong kong , going to visit our factory tomorrow in china i 'm so excited to meet the people who make my designs so beautiful and perfect i really owe it all to them and ca n't wait to make the whole new collection here . so far we 've had an awesome time even though the jet lag after the hour flight has been strong .
well , as most of my books are sold direct to libraries and schools this may not be such a problem . but , i know as a consumer , i am more likely to pick up a book which i like the cover of , than a plain boring cover that just contains the title and author names . so , i had to think of something good .
a cat died and went to heaven . god met her at the gates and said you have been a good cat all these years . anything you want is yours for the asking . the cat thought for a minute and then said all my life i lived on a farm and slept on hard wooden floors . i would really like a fluffy pillow to sleep on .
hope for the release of spiritual dogma i do nt think that s the right word , so if you know the proper word here please tell me in the comments between opposite religions . if one wants to believe in their god or whatever they re called then so be it , let them believe anyway that s what i hope for most , world peace between everyone .
we 've had a rough week here , mommy being sick and all the kids seemed to turn on me the other day , like they knew i was well enough to handle them misbehavin ' but not really well enough to take care of it properly well , meal times have become a joke in the last two days , i could n't get either kid to eat anything
so that s the goals recap for april . not the worst showing on earth . i think i m on my way to some good new habits and i think i ll do my best to keep up with them . it ll be interesting to see what may has to offer . but , that s another post for another time that time being about minutes from now
now here s where you come in first , i would really love your feedback because it gives me a good idea of how to improve the videos , so you can enjoy them more . and i would love to hear how your nut milk turned out what nut did you use , did you add any flavours , was it easy , tasty leave your comments below .
it s easy to respond , all my life , but that s not quite true . i did nt start writing with the intent to publish until about five years ago . sure , i d written some full length stories that will never see the light of day , but those were really more for me than anything else . now , i write for my fans .
sometimes the organizations are flexible , since every kid is experiencing this , especially when they 've added on these extra things that are not the core of the program . however other times there is no tolerance for anything less than participation . in pursuit of receiving national awards , one team my son was on had a three absences and you 're kicked off the team policy .
we also had some pretty deep conversations . she was hurt with how news of my divorce went down . i was upset with her for lack of support and for acting like a victim . there is still some tension there , but we fixed things a little bit last night . this has been sitting for two years , so it was good to talk in person .
it also made me wonder how i would answer that question . if someone asked me , who are your people my answer would nt connect the dots the way it did in this small southern town . my people come from all over . they believe in different things , they lead different lives . i do nt even get to see some of my people in person .
i live by grace . and i walk by faith every single day . i ve also discovered there is a strong , knowing , wise inner part of me some people get all spiritual about and identify as god s voice or the holy spirit . that works for me , but calling it my gut works just as well . he put it there , after all .
he knew who he was an angel a heavenly host , but he could not remember almost anything that had led up to his fall . it was a black spot in his mind except for an image that haunted him . it was of her a girl . he knew he must know her but he could not remember her name or any connection they may have had .
my kids are funny . they have grown so much this year and their personalities have become more and more apparent as time has gone by . they say silly things and crack me up . sometimes i have to turn my head so they ca n't see the smile i 'm trying to hide because i really should n't crack a smile at what they 've just said .
and in the meantime , since i ca n't build a time machine and go back to school and get a different degree , i spend some of my time trying to get as much education as i can on subjects about communication and language as i try to understand why my son has such a problem with his . came across this today and thought i would share .
although the previous article did not attract the response i was hoping for which may have been a blessing in disguise , i think the time is now ripe for that follow up posting way too many strange things have been happening lately , and it s time for some light to be shed on these matters , as it does not seem as if anyone else is doing it
i am ready to go forward and see what has in store . i usually do n't make new year 's resolutions , so i will just call this a goal . my goal for is to try to document my life better , good or bad . that is the reason i started this blog in the first place , and i got too busy to do it .
now i do n't know if this is a real story . i also do n't know who wrote the words to the senior edition of jesus loves me . doing a search was no help either , so i will assume these words are public domain . if you know otherwise , please let me know and i will be happy to give credit where it is due .
with that said , mft has to be the best company out there to work for , and i am so grateful for the last months it has been a blast creating with their stamps hopefully when if things ever slow down , kim will consider letting me come back i 'm still on the team through the end of january , so i 'm not done with them yet
my oven and i decided to take a short break from each other , so i checked out for the last week . that gave me more time to look up recipes on the internet as if i needed an excuse . i 'll be back to my regular posting tomorrow , but , for now , i thought i 'd share some of my favorite on line recipe resources
i 'm writing the next one now my fifth novel , wow , it feels amazing to say that . it 's set down by a beach so i 'm finding it a bit tricky , with all this snow on the ground , to write lovely sunny beach scenes . luckily i have booked a holiday ahem , i mean research trip in order to help me with that
i m still struggling with my patient communication thing . i have a really hard time talking to the patients . i m pretty good at reading lab values , looking over the chart , understanding the disease process , and knowing what needs to be done , but when it comes to actually having to have a conversation with them , i still have a really hard time .
today , i did something very embarrassing . you see , i have this goal of getting into better shape . i ve also been trying to cook more at home , knowing that anything i make for myself will be healthier than something i pick up at the store when it s the middle of the afternoon , i have nt eaten yet and i m super hungry .
our understanding and our attitude toward god can change . but one thing for sure , we can not change god . if changes are to be made , they must be made in us . god does not change . he can not get better . he does not need to improve . no such weakness exists in god . his perfection makes him worthy of our praise .
i 'm going to have to look up this lady just to make sure she is a real porn actress and not at all because i like porn . i 'm not into that . i may invite her to something else that maybe she has never been to , as that seems to be the right angle . maybe the library church something unlikely like that . . .
a few weeks ago i was digging through some of my old memory boxes trying to find something i wanted to show my girls and happened upon my childhood sticker book , my old journal calendar , and a notebook i shared back and forth between my high school friend sarah everyday they were so excited to see these treasures from my childhood and younger years and so was i
christmas is tomorrow and i could n't be happier . all four of my daughters , my brother and sister in law , two of jen 's kids , and her sister and mother will all be at my house for dinner tonight . jen and i no doubt will be going nuts with all the company , yet , neither of us would have it any other way .
. tokyo is huge . most people already know it s a big city . we constantly hear that it has the largest amount of people in the world , and we see pictures of the famous cross walk all the time . but after a hour ride on a subway from the airport to almost downtown , i finally understood how big this city really is . hint big
i truly appreciated all of your comments re the last post . your support means more to me than i can express . even though i do write for myself , i d be lying if i did nt say that it makes me happy that others find something in what i write . i ve still not bothered reading the thread . i left that up to you .
it s a good thing tom and i got married or i d never know about this amazing combination of flavors . the next time we go to north carolina , it will be as vegans and we wo nt be able to order that same sandwich but that s ok . my vegan version is even better and will be a favorite of ours til death to us part .
wednesday bonus a woman who is a senior in college was dating a man that studied abroad for a year . though they agreed to break up , she eventually went to europe to visit him and things rekindled . however , he began seeing a woman soon after she returned home , and she is nt sure whether or not to move on and never speak to him again .
i 'm allowing myself to be officially depressed . there 's no reason to fight it because i 've been becoming it since the middle of the night when i sat up with a cup of coffee and tried to deny it . it 's always better to acknowledge it and give into it than to try and act as if there 's nothing wrong , which is impossible anyway .
and so this concluded one of my final projects of my second year at university . although i m sure i ll be keeping myself busy over the summer with various other projects i ll be challenging myself to do . this was probably the most fun i ve had whilst working on something at university . just because you were so free to experiment and push your ideas far .
so while i do nt normally push my work so much , i strongly recommend everyone read the article , as there are some astonishing facts found in it . i , for one , was not aware of the extent of child labour in our times . did you know that there are an estimated million children currently affected by child labour that s of all children around the world
also during the start of my blogging experience , the constant losing in football made others and myself constantly questioning my ability as a coach and left me miserable more times than not . it was ugly for me in every sense of the word , as my feelings of self worth centered around what we did on the football field and how people thought of me as a coach .
what i like the first thing that stands out to me with the world vision gifts is the great design of the website . sure that may have little to do with the actual gifts , but as a designer , this is important to me and shows me they are doing it well and that it s not just a side thought or just another way to raise funds .
i stared at the last paragraph in awe eyed wonder . hidden rooms treasures this was not something i could pass up , i was going to have to explore the school very thoroughly , to see if i could prove any of this and also , a small part of me was very aware that amelia would never read this book , could never know the secret it contained .
after all that eye candy , those delicious cocktails and divine personalities , it was pumpkin time for me . yes i was tempted to stay and party the night away , but with another round of cocktails scheduled with some delightful ladies for today , i chose to get my beauty sleep and do it all again . and that my friends , will be a story for tomorrow .
d and this is why you should have read the whole thing . i said scientists believed this to be true not that it was or ever is in my opinion . by not reading my arguments you have shown your level of ignorance all i can say is shut it i do nt want you or no religous crap trying to say oh i am right on my wall .
today in my inbox was an email with his name on it with the subject line , remember me . in the body of the email among other things he said he did nt know why this was happening after years , but he recently had nt been able to stop thinking about me and that he was beating himself up over the way he d handled everything with me .
my wife and friends tell me i m giving chain restaurants too much credit for caring about my health . some say it s a matter of restaurants being too cheap to buy enough dishware for a busy evening . others say it s the economics of table turn a less than subtle way of telling you it is time to go , there are others waiting for your table .
there 's not a whole lot to write about the gardens right now . i do try to update every fortnight or so just to watch the growth . it is kind of neat to look back at how small it all started . we always have the harvest to look forward to . kate will have to dry some herbs this fall so we can use them all winter long
. finally , would someone please explain these shoes both the price , about at today 's exchange rate and their appeal . my younger child , who was with me when i took the photo , was puzzled about how they should be worn and suggested that they come with a users ' guide . i 'll give you a hint what wo n't be on my top list .
in the mean time , my garden is just freshly turned waiting for the seedlings and seeds and now its not helping my colour issue i do need to change that . starting tomorrow i am going to have one coloured vegetable at each meal and eat it before i wolf down my protein i might have to start looking into creative ways to incorporate the colours into my foods .
i die cut the label shape from some wood grain paper from creative imaginations and stamped the sentiment , starting with the second half on the bottom , and then stamped the rest right above it . since you can see right through the stamps , if any of the sentiments are too long , you can simply ink up half at at time and use them this way instead .
what do you think have you ever had an experience like this out in public how did people react and how did those reactions affect you if you have nt experienced this personally , do you know someone who has or have you ever witnessed someone going through this let me know in the comments . also , be sure to check back friday for a very special guest post .
continuing with my series on what the passion narrative can teach us about international development , i pick up the story on the night jesus was arrested in the garden , praying to god for guidance . he knew he was going to suffer and that even after three years together , his friends and followers would not really have the mettle to stand by him in his moment of need
he went to bed at his normal time on thursday night , but he got up about an hour later . we made him go back to bed and told him that the tooth fairy could n't come until he was asleep . we heard him singing in his room for a while , and then everything was quiet , so i decided to risk it and go on in .
if of sexual predators are religious this means that predators believe something . this is not an attack on anyone s religious beliefs . this is a billion dollar health care crisis that is being ignored . the government , you and i are all paying for the physical and psychological abuse that comes from sexual violence within all kinds of family backgrounds not limited to spiritual beliefs or race .
wet . that 's the word to describe the weather here in malaysia . it 's unusually cool in usually sunny malaysia . my laundry is not dry . i am not pleased . yes the rain is great . it leaves an after chill . it makes your body want to sleep and sleep some more . sometimes , you even do n't have to switch on the fan .
so , my new goal is to wake up each morning and not focus on the immediate affects of waking up . instead , i will try harder to thank god for the new day as i open my eyes . i 'll try looking forward to the blessings in store for me that day , and maybe waking up and starting a new , healthier routine will become easier .
the thing about being a reader of my blog is that you re instantly a really special person in my life , whether i actually know you or you re just passing through , because you get a peek into this thing we can call my mind . actually , probably even my soul . my writing is usually the most vulnerable , honest , and open part of myself .
what do children of today want to read just good stories , i think , as they always have . i never knew what i wanted until it was in my hands and it was past my bedtime , and i could nt bear to put the light out till i d read one more chapter . but i think that s just as true of adults and their books .
having participated in this week long exercise , i knew even some knowledge of the computer will help . i was given the task to fill out report cards from last year , so i put some daydreaming into action . if you are wondering now in the middle of the school term , it is because the form ii students ' national examination results were not posted until early .
well i am not sure if the gods are against me having a good day , or that they just enjoy seeing miserable people , hahaha big laughs at the expense of me nevertheless , the most frustrating thing , when your day , just can not get any better , is when someone half important tells you , do nt worry there is always someone worse of than you .
getting back to spices , there are some great tips on growing your own spice garden and how to store fresh herbs i did n't know you could freeze them . both suggestions i hope to take part in soon . i can imagine the garden being a relaxing experience , and hopefully next months book , the complete idiot 's guide to meditation , will be relaxing as well .
bill does n't think he has to do much when he returns home , but child support has other ideas . will bill turn his life around and create a good environment for his two sons it turns out he not only has to clean his living quarters , but also win over the love of his older son as well as rid his younger son 's drug running occupation .
also , i am passionate about history , which a lot of people young and old , think of as boring . but , of course , it s not . and it seems to me that young readers may not even realize that when they are reading about titanic they are studying history and doing research . so it s a fantastic topic to help students discover historical thinking .
okay , so i was all in pain with the mysterious back hip problem . that pretty much lasted a whole month . i never went to a doctor , just kind of waited for it to go away , which it finally seems to have done . now i just feel rather blah bad , not like really bad , which i guess is mostly normal for me now .
the flag hanging on our house is the flag my mother in law was given at my father in law 's funeral . i did n't know them and had not met their son yet , but i am close to my brother in law and sister in law and enjoy hearing their family stories and seeing their family pictures . my father in law was in the coast guard .
so overall for me harry potter wins out with books and movies . magic themed books and movies has more variety and interest than vampires who are still playing to a certain mold with a few little twists . of course this is all my opinion . many friends of mine love the twilight and think it far superior because vampires are a lot more interesting to them than magic .
it is natural to desire a nice job , car , home , or loving partner . but when we feel that we are not ok without them , then those things possess us , hold us in some way . they become temporary gap fillers and will not bring us the lasting happiness we truly seek . the desire for them will bring about not joy , but suffering .
the divorce is very complicated and of course i can not discuss it in public yet i have no idea what my financial status is going to look like and wo nt know for another few months . the best i can do is move forward with my life and keep paying down the marital debt and adding to the marital assets . at some point it will all work out .
i turn away . without my help she will make it home . she will crawl back in our bed and in an hour or so will come down to our kitchen with no memory of this . she may notice her dirty feet or she may not . she will take my hand from across the table and , with eyes matching her words , tell me she loves me .
thank you , from the bottom of my heart , for allowing god to use each of you . you ca n't possibly understand how much you have touched the hearts of each person in my family . if i do n't tell you individually , know that your kindness does not go un noticed . i see it . but most importantly , god sees it . and he smiles .
this week , i am sharing with you one of my creations , that i created sometime ago for a friend , but somehow missed posting about it . it came handy today . at pcc , this week the challenge is to create a card lo craft item using a tag or tags . so i created a gift card holder with a tag to write in some special message .
our fabulous sketch for this challenge was designed by sue and i loved using it . i had a special card to make for my aunt 's birthday and i was so pleased with how it came together with this sketch , i hope she will be too . this is an x card so lots of space to fill , which was a bit scary after not crafting for so long
the song itself does n't seem to follow in the same tone of the video . just looking at the lyrics alone , it seems she is talking about a relationship in the song . however , with the video , the song takes on a whole new meaning about finding or trying to fit in or be accepted and then deciding not to fit in and do your own thing .
there is yet one more reason i have nt shot as many flower photos this spring as i normally would , and that is my current quest to take an excellent photo of every species of wildlife that i possibly can . getting an excellent photo over just a very good photo takes time . for example , i spotted a male cardinal singing from the top of a tree today .
i finished the socks , but they are too small for me . that 's what i get for not taking a minute out of my busy day to try them on as i 'm knitting . it 's in the 's f now anyway . too hot to wear . i 'll have to reknit them and hope they are finished by november when it 's cool enough for wool .
i know its only been days since my last entry but i feel like i 've neglected this family journal of mine . i 've been taking pictures and starting blog entries i just have n't had the time to complete them or finish editing the pictures . and do n't even get me started on how neglected my homemade christmas gifts have been . starting to get nervous about that .
i had a vision of how this card should look and now that it 's complete i believe it turned out better than that vision and that 's really rare for me . i am a huge fan of pollycraft digital images and this one is no exception . the pollycraft monday challenge is white winter , they are looking for a guest designer too wish me luck so here it is
i think , just judging from what i have read , that all of this stuff is pretty normal . i have entered that miserable stage of pregnancy where i am too big uncomfortable exhausted to get much done and i am too over it to care . i just want to have a damn baby now . for fuck s sake , when am i going to have a damn baby
tickets are booked . we leave in days . as we prepare to be gone for a few weeks , reality is setting in . two little ones will soon be home looking back over the last few months , i am so thankful for all of you . you are a special group of people who have lifted up our family one way or another . we are very appreciative .
working from home is absolutely amazing . work has been pretty slow so i 'm not sure i 've gotten a true taste of what it could be like , but i 've really enjoyed being able to sleep in , get errands done , hang out with my puppy and keep the tv all while i 'm working . and doing that in yoga pants is n't half bad either .
but , we survived it and in one piece , too we are just about done with the whole shopping thing for this year . there are only a few more presents to be wrapped and i got a really good start on the baking candy making yesterday . the cards are done the groceries bought the menu planned everyone invited . all in all , we are in pretty good shape
in this scenario , the consumers are highly aware of the task they have and are actively looking out for solutions to fulfill it . but the ability of the product to accomplish the task may not be evident right away . marketing is therefore vital to bridge that gap of understanding . a story needs to be told about how the product acts and delivers impact on people s life .
i chose to do a video format because it makes sense and falls in line with the feeling of excitement i want to convey to the audience . if i simply used photos or wrote about the fights it would nt have nearly the same impact as seeing the punches thrown with your own eyes . the music i added i feel adds to the drama being shown on the screen .
as i previously mentioned , the rain situation has been incredible over here , and we have been searching for ways to keep the rain stored . the barrels are to be attractive features , and part of the garden decor . while browsing the internet , i came across pictures of rain chains . i had never heard of them before , so looked into their designs a little more .
i will always remember you . i will always encourage others to remember you too . it 's hard though because the farther away from your birth death we get , the less people talk about you . i will always say i have three children . i will never deny you no matter how it makes other people feel . you matter . you always have and you always will .
yeah , i know everyone and her uncle loves this book , but it was one of my favorite books of the year . it was one of those books that makes me wonder why i 'm even trying to write , when there are people who so , so , good at it . this book was sent to me by the publisher , little , brown books for young readers .
remember how i used to make beer battered fish on you , until you made a little fire at the bottom of the oven those were good times . and good fish , too . i could really go for some beer battered fish right about now . but instead i 'm going to make frozen spinach out of my emergency food reserve and tear apart the kitchen again looking for you .
this is an interesting cheese . it would make a good conversation piece on a cheese plate . because it is subtle , i think that most people would find it pleasant . it would be entertaining to see how different guests would describe it . i expect there would be a lot of hmmm s and a few i m not quite sure but ultimately the simple conclusion it s good .
i did nt start to love the church by just willing change , i asked god to help me . i pray this prayer about people sometimes jesus , please help me love them before i hate them . and i did this with church , and it worked . i acted like i loved the church before i really did , i think they say fake it till you make it .
despite the fact that the big texas prayer event fell somewhat short of the big ass party to celebrate the establishment of hell on earth i suspect they were hoping for , these folks have by no means given up . oh no , definitely not and , as our friend rachel maddow s latest report makes very clear , these christian soldiers seem more intent than ever to march on into history
the supper was rather short . we just sat around that lone environmental candle that i brought , did nt even drink the fire water that jenny brought , and went to sleep . it was cold or maybe people were just tired after that quite difficult trail . mostly due to the cold wind blowing from the ocean . seriously , even in alaska last year i was nt that cold .
everyone walks into our lives for one reason or another . it s not necessarily clear why they enter our lives when they do , but they enter it and leave it with a purpose . we are meant to know them when we know them . it s up to us to figure out why we were blessed to have them in our lives , no matter how brief an encounter .
i did nt know for sure until you admitted it just now , but i thought it had to be something like that . could nt figure out why you d offer up the card without being asked , but when i looked at your crime scene photos and saw what a good photographer you are , i figured you did nt want to take a chance on losing your best work .
my favorite change is being a wife to my husband . he is one of the greatest humans i have ever met . he is calm and patient . he is honest and human . he is also loving . he is also the reason for all of these changes all fabulous . i think having him through all of these changes has made my life so easy the last few months .
a group of officials arrived and advised the head of the household , who went out to see them , that they were not to tell anyone about what had taken place . however , with the death of the parents , the story has now been told . a full report will , of course , be contained in volume if we can get the events of into that particular volume .
so what do you think are you up for the challenge we 'd love to have you join us on friday we 'll be sure and put out several hints ahead of time to let you know how many photos to pull as well as any additional items you might need so you can be as ready as possible . so get your calendars marked and we 'll see you during happy hour
and on that note , i ll finish this rant . i felt i had to say something . let s attack the problem from the angle of the minority who ca nt engage in a meaningful dialogue with their kids and who do nt care if they start drinking at ten years old . but leave the rest of us to live our lives productively and quietly and as a community .
i wanted to write a quick follow up post on what to do after you have built your new koi pond as far as keeping the water clear and getting it ready for fish . in my last post on this topic , i got you right up to the point of filling your pond with water . you may be asking yourself , now what well it is really quite simple .
in the end , i looked pretty good if i say so myself . i went with one of my close friends who everyone mistakes for my sister and we had a lot of fun catching up with old friends . after i got home , i called up my best friend and we chatted until two in the morning , only ending the call because we were moments from falling asleep .
today i learned a dear friend lost a baby weeks ago . i was able to share my experience with her , and she was grateful that i understood . i am too . this kind of pain . i would n't wish it on anyone . but i 'm grateful still that you were mine for those few weeks , and i have hope that you 'll belong to me forever .
i have to say i struggled a bit with the sketch but hope you like it you may want to play along and here 's where you should head for the current sketch at card patterns httpcardpatterns.blogspot.comsketch.html over there you will get to see lots of inspiring cards from their design team happy card making and have a wonderful day , everyone i need to go , i 'll see you soon .
the day is started off with uplifting activities , allowing students , staff , and community members to drop their guard and prepare for opening their minds and their hearts . next came small group discussions . i was paired with five students i had never met or even seen before . the stories which were shared in my family of students as the program leaders called them made me say wow .
we learnt about how to colour the icing , make all the different shaped decorations , pipe icing onto the cakes basically everything that s on top of the cakes was made from scratch . we started off with just rough balls of white icing and it all started from there . it was a lovely relaxing break from the real world and i was totally engrossed in creating my little cake accessories
parents used weather as an excuse . but the cdc looked at weather patterns in four large cities in each of the four main regions of the country and found some slight variations in weather patterns over the past years . however , there is no distinct pattern to these changes over time . therefore , it does not seem likely that changes in weather account for the decline in active transport .
. it takes twice as long to lose new muscle if you stop working out than it did to gain it . lazy people out there should nt use this as motivation to not work out , however . it s relatively easy to build new muscle tissue and get your muscles in shape , so if anything , this fact should be motivation to get off the couch and get moving .
this has happened before . i 'm sure he 'll be back next time the date was earlier this month , so maybe he had a conflict . but it was n't helping at that particular point . i had practically promised certain people vintage cards in exchange for the few ' topps that i needed because i knew that this guy would have them . and now he was n't there .
being as i had been in the waiting room for eight hours at that point , and all i could really think about is is she alive or not , i did not , at that time , really think this through . but , friends , as i 'm typing , i 'm suddenly sort of realizing that this shit should n't have gone down this way , no pun intended .
thanks to everyone who participated in last week 's challenge . we look forward to seeing your creations for this week 's challenge . your projects need to be posted by sunday , may and the winners will be announced on tuesday , may . if by any chance , the inlinkz button is not present , please send and email to me and i will make sure to get it fixed .
here is a random back pic of me in the dress and hat combo from last night . you ca n't see it in this photo , but the back of the dress is really low cut and at the time i was a bit larger was super out of my comfort zone maybe one day i will dig out the wedding photos and take you all on a trip down memory lane
the process of expansion into higher consciousness requires that we honor universal principles as well as the natural environment , and thus allow ourselves to be guided by them . achieving this is an enormous step , for when we are truly in harmony with these things we are able to express the authentic essence of who it is that we are as spiritual beings thus becoming one with all of life .
hey , do you want some no , i ca nt eat that , i ll die . remember when you could eat food , and that d be the end of it you eat it . and you forget about it . not anymore . my body ca nt process certain foods anymore . not only will my stomach hurt , but random other parts of my body will hurt too .
so all i can say is go . have a wonderful time and learn a lot . if there is one zoo , or animal park , i am already very excited about taking my daughter to on my next trip to the uk it is this one . it is worth every penny and , as an added bonus , is n't far from the coast or the lake district either .
since my dad has moved into the nursing facility , my mother has made it her mission to visit him twice daily and spend time with him having devotions in both the morning and the evening . this is something very meaningful for him and she makes the effort to be there . fortunately , the facility is just up the block and takes her only about minutes travel from door to door .
but how exactly am i supposed to get my life back together if no one is willing to give me a chance i had the money to pay her . i ca n't find much else that would have been affordable as this place . the others one that are do n't happen to be accessible to mass transit . with my continuing car issues i need to be on a bus line .
the same was true for cleaning . i do nt want to bring dirty stuff into my beautiful new house so i was cleaning each item as i was packing it away . now i have days before the agent wants to move , i have kids crying at my ankles , and i am too busy to take time off from work . i need to get the stuff done this weekend .
i do nt know that it did . i had a writing group of people i d met on the ma and we all worked quite closely together , workshopping each other s work chapter by chapter as we had done the year before . it was a bit more scary though i felt i could nt make a mess of the second book , as i already had the two book deal .
she replied , you know , i am trying to figure out what to do about a little girl at school that is being mean to chloe . chloe came home from school crying . this girl wo nt stop calling her names . i tried telling their teacher before that this little girl is mean to chloe but the teacher keeps saying the girls have to work things out on their own .
johnny was stunned . it was the last thing he expected to hear . also , he did n't like her if i do n't get rid of this attitude . as far as he was concerned this was a potential child she was speaking about , and there was no way he was going to pay for an abortion . he reached out , put his hand on hers and gently said ,
so we head to the grocery store finally and once home i call my mom to see what her plan is . of course katie wants to spend the night over there with her cousins . should have seen that one coming . and then she asked if they could come spend the night over here tomorrow . of course they can ... especially if it means that you are going to come home
based on scripture , those millions of christians who think brown is wrong are wrong . this is nt an issue decided by popular vote . the majority of people in alabama could vote and pass a resolution indicating that i m seven feet tall , but i m not sorry to disappoint you . every person in the whole world could think brown is wrong , but they would also be wrong .
we never know what life has in store for us certainly , i did nt . however , it is much more gratifying to fight than to surrender to fears and to the unknown . i believe we have all been put on this earth to teach and to learn therefore , it is my way to justify my existence . there is always hope , no matter how difficult your challenges are .
there were about of us for the big dinner on the saturday night , which was followed by a trip to the local pub where turns were taken by those of us who could sing a good story , and it turned out there were a few who could do it very well . i ca nt sing , so i listened and wished that i could sing a story with as much aplomb
michael had n't always hated his wife . i suppose that goes without saying . who gets married to someone they hate the hatred came slowly , from a ' honey do ' list , and on to little ways of controlling his life . it could be argued that he was overreacting to a normal marriage , but that 's beside the point now , his marriage will never be normal again .
however , if you want to t shirts for girls then at this online shopping store , you will get diverse styles , colors , designs and sizes in t shirts for girls . like , the famous brand mango has come up with latest variety in t shirts . the photos of t shirts have been put on the website so that it becomes easy for you to make the right selection .
you also think about all problems in your other books . one of the problems with my books is depth . in all my books a change in one chapter means going back and changing five other chapters . it 's a pain when it comes to editing . it 's a style i like and want to keep , but i run the risk of each novel becoming more and more complex .
what really needs attention in the last chapter are the main relationships . how did the narrator change how did the method you 're teaching shift your way of approaching life how did the character realize something show us how the primary players changed , how something new was realized or achieved or lost . demonstrate a new state of being and you 'll have the reader hooked , hungry , and happy .
hi hope you are having a good week so far i ca n't believe it is wednesday already it 's sure been busy for me . we have some dear friends coming to visit from out of town tomorrow and i need to have everything ready before they arrive . i ca n't wait to have some crafty time with my buddy , too it 's been too long since we 've gotten together
i hate that this is even a topic of conversation when i 'm only weeks pregnant . i wish we could just have a normal pregnancy and know that we will take this baby home , but we have to prepare for ifs . i hope so much that i wo n't have any more bleeding and this pregnancy will be very successful . please send positive thoughts our way if you can .
i m sure there are times when i should have done research , but that does nt mean i did it , and it was never really necessary . that s the nice thing about fantasy and horror often you can just cheat and go with the not recommended but oh so easy because i m the author and i said so explanation rather than try to write something based in scientific fact .
today , i d like to take you for a trip with my mom and dad which i did nt even go on . actually , it s a couple of trips , but who s counting dad received a small disability pension from the government . it was nt much , but it made the difference between being stuck in a small town , and affording to take the occasional road trip .
by now readers here know that i was raised in a baptist church . another confession i wondered why god wanted us to work so hard to seek him . if i sought with all of my heart , then i may find him . as with several other important concepts in my life , being a parent has brought me much close to an understanding of this game of hide and seek .
but today is a new day and so far so good . i have just made up some pancake batter and i am just about to cook some up . now i know what you are thinking , pancakes are not healthy but i added up the calories and they are about each , so if i have two and top with strawberries and small amount of maple syrup , i should be fine
but what if there are not many orders for my book after all if all the copies that are ordered are covered by the first print run and then there are only a few copies ordered after that , when will the rest of the , copies of my book which i have already paid for be published and why have nt even the first few orders been sent out yet he asked .
arguments about religion have a place , but that place is in private discussions on the subject . religion is a choice , a belief and just as much as being a christian does not make you a better person , so too does not being a christian not make you bad or evil . we are with our backs to a wall and we can not at this stage afford such arguments .
this has been one of my most favorite hops that i 've been a part of . i love upcycling projects what better way to push and test your creativity and try new things i had so many ideas for this one that i had to narrow it down to a few . for this post , at least . i 'll post the other projects i did over the next few days .
the party was outside at a fabulous local park and the perfect setting for our fun filled afternoon . i used the easter party package from dimpleprints to create this bright and fun party . i had a short turn around time and put the party together in weeks , but i love how it turned out and the kids had lots of fun here are some of the pictures from the party .
we must be willing to look beyond the status quo to ensure we are making the most of available technology and resources to support and extend one of the most fundamental aspects of science communication . at its most basic , communication is the simple act of sharing knowledge at its most inspirational , it helps us to form our ideas about the world and leads to new concepts , understanding and applications .
in my district we 're given numerous forms for tracking reading progress for each child throughout the year . sometimes it feels like we have way too much paperwork , but i love to look at one sheet of paper and see at a glance how a student has progressed during the year . and it 's easy to show parents the growth their child has made or the growth they need to make
reading has a huge impact and driving force for my life , i have personally experienced to take massive action after a good read . it creates the mental muscles like working out your body in the gym . he questions when is the last time we pushed our self good question if you have nt really pushed your self and taken a massive change in life this is time to make it ..
all of their hard work means that i only have four more candy bars to reveal to you today , sisters and brothers . for part of this four part feature on old time candy i randomly selected bars but this time i picked four more that continued some of the trends above two individually bagged treats , a treat i 'd never heard of before , and an old favorite of mine .
in the last month plus a few days , we 've packed our home , found renters for our old house , visited in laws , driven part way across country as a family , stayed in temporary housing in dc , traveled to alabama for my husband 's training , and determined that we have no idea where we 'll be living this summer plus , the baby is n't sleeping at night .
my baby 's now been on the outside longer than he was on the inside as of last friday . yes , i did the math . he 's becoming his own person , wanting to crawl away and explore on his own . he always comes back , though , and climbs up my leg to make sure i 'm still there and that i ca n't move even if i wanted to .
we missed church on sunday , the boys had a really rough night . we rarely miss , but we did this week . and naturally , by late morning everyone was back to themselves , so instead of staying inside the rest of the day , we took the kids to a local farm for their easter egg citment party so glad we did . it turned out to be a great family day
wow i never post this late in the day i 've been so busy getting ready for a class i have tomorrow night have n't had the chance to get this post done . i 'm waiting to find out how many students i have in the class , so i thought i 'd take a few minutes to post a few of the projects i 've been working on for my alaska project .
they stopped for a few minutes and she went to the grave sides of her family . jenny placed a kiss on the top of each cold gray grave stone and pulled a few blades of grass that had grown too long , from in front of their names and the one stone meant for herself someday . the one on the empty grave that said the good girl across the front of it .
the stable looks as if it 's about to fall down and yes , there are a few horses in there . so , i did call and complain to the proper authorities about a week ago . i drove by today and one horse is gone , though perhaps he has just been moved to a farther field . this is a stables company after all . the other adult and baby remain .
anyways . it has been a month now since her birthday and oh what a field of emotions that have ensued since . i am just now getting to put up the pictures of her birthday . it was a beautiful night , and just how i had hoped . an elegant promising proud evening to honor our daughter , our first born whom we are so proud of and raised to this age .
it s always a shock when someone new comes to visit our apartment . on a good day , when my roommates and i actually clean , it looks rather nice and like any other college apartment . however , that all seems to change when they reach my desk and my side of the bedroom . anyone who has ever met me immediately knows that i live on that side of the room .
i feel like i want to start a new big project but i 'm just not getting the inspiration any ideas of how to get inspired usually it comes to me when i least expect it so i maybe need to just hang around a but longer and wait for it to come to me . either that or get the love back for the two big projects that were started and then mothballed .
so this unemployment rate has been really stubborn . there are a couple of ways that we can solve that . number one is to make sure that the overall economy is growing . and so we have continued to take a series of steps to make sure that there s money in people s pockets that they can go out there and spend . that s what these payroll tax cuts were about .
that there 's been a gold rush going on ever since is undeniable . it 's too early to say whether the rush has finished . on the other hand , it 's starting to look like the gold has gone , and that 's what i want to talk about . by ' the gold ' , i mean the better than average chances of success for authors who decide to self publish .
anyway , the point is i still like having meals in my freezer , maybe not a month 's worth but enough to get you out of an emergency and avoid take away . this month we have to work around new clients , my self publishing a book , my husband being extra busy at work , my daughter changing her schedule and me attending the sydney writers ' festival for two days .
monday , february th was a great night . we had pizza at a slice of brooklyn and then we made a presentation at the th precinct community council meeting . there were a lot of people probably over . i was a little nervous because i have never done a presentation outside of school before . but , come to find out it was great and me and the other students did well .
i had to stop . obviously some of these thoughts i did not question or take seriously . but i did question why i would speak to myself like that . i know the importance of exercise and eating right . i know i want to take care of myself . i know right from wrong . so why is it that i could hear those thoughts why would i talk to myself like that
i am wondering if i should even attempt to write this post now . right now , while the big end of conference dance party rages on in the student union building outside my windows , i am busy packing . yes , i went to the party for a while , but i knew when it was time to leave a gift of insight that comes to you in your s , i believe .
i realize that car dancing is the part that makes your awesome car singing less easy to hide form passers by . but you know what you re already awesome car singing so who cares that person only wishes they were as good at car singing as you . so feel free to watch their lame , boring car drive away and sing with peace because you are a million times cooler than they are .
and here 's coats which is where i stopped . it held up this is on the video too these magnets no problem and these too even though they are not near as strong as the first . it can also hold up a piece of construction paper but if you want to hang lots of papers from it or if that 's your main purpose , you may want to paint more than coats .
other than my desire for a drastic life change , nothing really excited is going on around here , just trying to find new and innovative ways to keep my students from eating snow during my lessons . hope all is well . we miss you all and would love to see family and friends very soon , but we know our work here is far from done . pray for us till next time .
. excuse yourself to the bathroom at least five times . tell him it 's because you prefer to throw up your food instead of getting fat . also inform him that he 'll appreciate it when you two get married . this might get you a second date , though . i heard that guys love talking about marriage with a woman they just met . also , be careful on the baby subject .
if you find time to write in this form , please share your work with us , or perhaps you will find inspiration in the music and artwork featured here , and prefer to write something in your usual style . there is no time limit to our creativity , so i would encourage you to come back to this idea at a more convenient time , if you are unable to write this weekend .
when we moved in to our present house it was still a commercial property a gift shop to be precise though the estate agent assured us we just had to apply for residential use and it would be easy . we applied and got turned down the long story being that i then entered some six months correspondence with local council everyone else and we got permission for residential use at the end of it .
it is . and features different tutorials for you to watch and get the most out of pages . there s plenty of free stuff out there for you , but if you were to use this application for work , or to formally publish , it might be worth the expense for you . click here to see a sample tutorial . i have to admit , it appears to be very well done .
so tuesday of this week was our last night all together , though one woman in the group was on an extended thanksgiving vacation trip to hawaii lucky , and of course we did lose a few folks during the weeks . but those of us who were there spoke to the group on topics such as why we joined , what the program has meant to us , and what we are taking away .
my dog and i have a long road ahead of us green . just the two of us with the help of my lovely barmaid , of course this is my last story for a while , the one that i 'm working on right now that is . and while not every story deserves a happy ending , writing gives you the power to change things . sometimes , even the past you know that
we worked at the same home improvement store i was a cashier and he was a department manager . we hit it off immediately as friends . i even tried to give him away to a friend of mine luckily , they did n't have any chemistry . because i would have wanted him for myself eventually . it did n't take long for us to fall in love and decide to move in together .
economics is a part of our everyday lives . because the state of the economy plays such a central role in our local , state and national politics , people should be aware of how the economy is doing and what effect government s policies have on the economy . while the responsibility of making economic policy belongs to national and world leaders , we need to understand how their decisions can affectwisconsin s economy .
after three years in the industry , this was my first field visit , and a dream come true . i will finally be able to meet members of the great organizations that we work with and shake hands with some of the clients that we work so hard to help . i was so excited to see it all with my own eyes and to share it all with you . hope you stay tuned
having the ability to determine the significance of sex on a case by case basis is not something that only men have the power to do . i wish i had understood at a much younger age that casual sex is amazing i can have casual sex , not because i do nt value myself but because i have more control over my emotional self . sometimes sex is just sex and that is okay .
i ca n't believe one year has gone by already . in reality it should be even longer but i figured i was n't computer smart and no way would i be able to do my own blog so i put it off and put it off . i was so glad one day i got tired of missing all the fun so i started this blog . it was easy time consuming but easy .
to me , this is utterly fascinating . a few days ago , i walked you through the ages of the disciples chosen by jesus and we concluded that all of them , with the exception of peter , were under the age of . now , when it comes time for paul to chose his disciples , he continues the tradition of his day and the tradition of jesus and he selects another kid .
i also see such occasions as opportunities to grow . often what hits me is nothing new . it may regard something that i ca nt escape . i want to grow in it , in my response to it . and i want to grow in better understanding how i m to live with reference to it . again , troubles should drive us to god , though sadly some turn away from god .
it 's that time again you might remember the great post in december that highlighted the natural parents network volunteer 's most popular or favorite posts from the year . well , we are back and this time we are bringing you a collection of posts that focus on do it yourself projects , how to 's , tutorials , recipes , and anything related to a step by step guide or informational how to .
they come in two sizes , so with five covers in each size , it 's about for birth to potty training for just the covers . but , two sizes means less wear and tear on each cover if you 're going to be using them for multiple children and if you have babies close together , you 'd need to buy extra covers if you 're using a one size cover , anyway .
pulse the nuts in a food processor until they are fairly well ground , and then throw in the dates and cocoa . process until it is an even consistency . you can press it into a pan and throw it into the fridge for a half hour or so before cutting into squares , but i like them better rolled into little balls . the batter seems to go much further this way . enjoy
in my chemo mother approaching senior brain , that mat is so many things to me . so many things that by the grace of god and the gift of his mercy , i have overcome . but here 's the rub , i still find myself wanting to sit back down on it , going back to thoughts and ways of thinking that do n't give witness to what he 's done in me .
one area i was n't really that organized in , ironically , was my blog . there were some nights i would stare at my computer screen as i was getting ready to post and not have a clue what i was going to write about . i would wing it and hope that a reader might be happy with it and come back the next day . yep , that 's how i rolled .
did your parents show you that men and women have positive roles in each other s lives did they respect each other did they teach you that you could feel secure and happy that you could do what you wanted to do and achieve what you wanted to achieve because nothing stood in your way how did they show you love was it giving or controlling how much control did you have over any of this
she called while driving home , to tell me she was okay even though she d had a flat and had to change it herself . late sunday night and no place was open , so she managed even though it was dark and no one else was around to help . good thing she knew how to change a tire . i would ve been calling a for help , waiting in my car .
can you believe the weekend is almost over where does the time go . yesterday i got up at am and drove to south bend , in for a card workshop . it was a blast except for the am and the long drive . my friend , julie hi julie and i went up to joan 's garden and attended her workshop . i wanted to show you one of the things we made .
as we walked home this halloween i asked the girls if they wanted to go to more houses along the way . they said they did n't , pointing out that they can wear costumes , eat candy and walk around in the dark any day . the only thing different on halloween is that they go knock on doors , and they had done enough of that to satisfy their needs for this year .
people have major problems and have a hard time seeking out help due to these situations that i have just explained and things in their lives continue to grow and fester for the worse . it is very unfortunate that certain matters get swept under the rug and people are walking in and out of the church mentally confused or dead . if a person s mind is not stable then how can anything else be
i 'm also really excited because my office is throwing me a small baby shower party type thingy on friday my last day . i 've been blessed with awesome co workers , and it feels nice to to be thought of by them before i leave . i am keeping my fingers crossed that there will be projects for me to work on at my current office so that i can return next year .
i used a chocolate cake recipe that i like because they are so light and moist secret ingredient in them is sour cream and of course i added additional cocoa powder i had never made them as cupcakes but so far every cake that i like works as cupcakes too . and for the filling , i completely made up a recipe that was delicious very light and fluffy . email me if you want it
we had thought , for an exciting moment , that it was something to do with the president and a movie star neighbor . we still do n't understand the point of the circling spotlight . i was catching it on film , in case . i had grabbed my phone before we rushed down , in case . it was only when we returned that i realized my quickly thrown on dress was inside out .
on the other hand , i do nt want to leave you all with the impression that i m not just as capable as the next guy of closing my eyes and pretending it ll all just go away if i ignore it . so , to that end , i ll conclude with a little more of the distracting noise this real world army of darkness is counting on to mask what they re up to
or how many times i had to get tyres changed and fixed on my first car because they went flat thanks to something getting stuck in them from going to football field parking lots in the dark to have sex in the car seriously if my dad did nt figure out what had been going on seeing as they all happened the days after i had been to see someone then i d question his intelligence .
i m really fabulous at starting things and quite the reverse when it comes to finishing something . fantastic ideas always come to me , and i never see them through . so right now , i want to take a quick look at what made this project different . what made me see it through to the point where it s actually out in the world and depending on other people to carry it further .
you can use pop dots to pop the letters off the page as i did in the top picture and really give them dimension . the letters are really cute and would look great on your guy pages i used them in my configurations box , just created a little pop up stand in back of each letter here . i hope you use these in your projects . i would love to see what you do
christ gave up his own life so the church could live . how can a husband possibly compare himself to christ loving the church i think he can by purposefully putting her needs , and even wants , before his own . i think he can demonstrate christ to her by being understanding , patient , kind , and not placing expectations of what his opinion of who and what she should be , on her .
am imagine my surprise when i entered the building at the address and did not find the pt s office . i found a gym . what aggressive pt therapy at this place , i thought . i asked the person at the desk if i was in the right place . no , of course not . she kindly directed me to the new location , where the pt practice had moved a year ago .
but i 've realized that it 's not enough . i can love someone beyond reason , and even if he somehow , someday , somewhere , returned the favour , it would n't be enough . i understand now , how and why people can walk away even from those they love dearly . it is strange to never have had much at all but to realize that you need so , so much more .
this game was played yesterday , in a new gaming club near my home . i m happy to have such a nice place nearby , and this was my first visit to it it was its second weekend . i knew there was going to be some wings of war , but was quite shocked to see people playing in a big table with lots of beautiful airplanes my past experience was with just cards .
shifting your focus from love to your purpose will eventually lead you the love your life . because all the while your praying for god to reveal what your purpose is in life , that path and journey you will take , will open up the things you were meant to acquire in this life time . purpose is taking me in a new direction , one that i had never imagined but did dream of .
in the last entry we established a focus area to narrow down our intelligence gathering efforts on four types of threats which gave us our where . those four types of threats and a little research gives us our who . now we need to look at the what aspect of it . there are some very simple questions we re going to use that may not necessarily have simple answers . something along the lines of
harmony is achieved in a room when all other design elements come together scale balance , and rhythm . you want to unify the room with a common element , it could be color , texture , or a shape . you also want to add some variety to shake things up . that 's where variety comes in , bring in a unique shape , color or texture so the room does n't feel boring .
allow me to preface this post with the following true statement i love my dad . he and i have always been close , and he is an excellent father . his is intelligent , kind , generous , and responsible . he also has a strong sense of integrity . because i know these things about my wonderful dad , i can say that when it comes to cleaning my dad gets kind of crazy .
i love rock city i could spend hours there taking pictures . around every turn there is something beautiful . it is the type of place that if i was one that liked to read , i would love to pick a spot , sit and read a good book and drink some coffee . well maybe some dr. pepper i often have thoughts like that , but then they go as quickly as they came .
first of all , i listen to the classical music station in my car while driving lots of the time . my kid have started asking who 's music is playing , and have also started picking out various instruments that are playing in the pieces that we are listening to . i love hearing my year old son saying mom these are violins playing or i hear the piano there . it 's makes me smile
for businesses , this is a time to get out there and meet the community . it is the chance to interact with people , and make contact with potential clients and customers in a way that advertising can never do . these festivals allow vendors to bring a personal touch and interaction into the products and services that they offer , on a higher level helps to grow that sense of community we all seek .
i might easily avoid something which another struggles with each day . and that is their struggle , which the lord will work with them on . he does n't need my help he knows fully what he 's doing , and what is the best approach for that person . i might not struggle with that thing they 're struggling with , but i have many other struggles . and my struggles are not theirs .
church number is a church that i already know two families at from our homeschool group . my issues with this church are smaller . the first being they are currently without a pastor , not that a pastor makes a church , but he can make a difference in a church . the other issue is more that my husband does n't love this church . i could probably settle here if he felt comfortable .
from early on , i had accepted the fact that they were as much our children as they were people in their own right . they were real human beings , just smaller . we always felt that they should be given as much responsibility as they could handle make their own decisions state their own opinions do their own work in their own time . our job was to mostly keep them from hurting themselves .
manchester definitely brought me closer to jungle though the people and scene is what makes it i do nt think you can appreciate it unless you experience it junglists are nt just people that like jungle or drum and bass , they re people that love it and everything it stands for , know its extensive history and it means more to them than just music or money making , there s some proper junglists in manchester
i really do nt know how to change this i have found this to be a universal feeling among step parents i have met out here in the blogosphere , but no one with any good solutions yet . other than maybe june carter cash who raised her children to believe that the only steps in the house were the ones you used to go up and down and did not extend to titles for people .
well , i hate to break it to you , but chances are you 're really really fat . what do you mean how do i know i simply know , do n't be confused by the mirror , it is controlled by the government who lies to you just so you can feel better and distracted from what 's really going on . but trust me , my friend , trust me you 're fat .
my friend let me stay . i told him i just needed time and he was very concerned for me and agreed not to call jack until i was ready . he wanted to help me but neither of us expected it to turn into four days . i finally agreed to let him call and tell jack i was safe after the first night . i 'm still not sure how that phone call went .
it 's happened a couple of times lately . this week , doing errands in the afternoon . i felt a push a hand on my back , deliberately pushing . i stumbled , turned around . not a soul in sight near me . no one anywhere , for half a block in each direction . just me and the push . not hostile , exactly , that push . but not exactly friendly either .
when i ask writers to get serious about making this list , they have to admit that even their closest family members probably wo nt buy their book . so you ll have to dig deep and go wide to come up with a true list of . and that s only a starting place . again , real buyers that you know would buy your book is where you want to get to over time .
so finally they were ready to go and our christmas was officially postponed . m t g was not happy about leaving all the rest of her presents at our house . i promised to bring all the things from santa and all the other presents to her house on sunday evening without fail . she sort of accepted that but there were a few tears shed . what did we expect she is just years old
i use a lot of brands of rubber stamps but my favorite brand by far is technique tuesday . the background on the white strip was made with a group of their stamp sets that i pulled one from this set and one from that set . i have decided if i ca n't find the right background paper i can pull out my stamps and create it i encourage you all to give it a try .
although the vast majority of those reading at this site take an interest in news and current affairs , and many of us spend hours tracking down the truth behind news stories we are a tiny minority . most of the public , especially the young , take little if any interest in the news , however , the media have other and far more powerful means of lying to them , through entertainment and popular drama .
at some point , i believe we will all be expected to be fluent in social media . from my perspective , this means that we will basically be unable to stay truly connected without it . this naturally leads one to question if social media is beneficial to those involved with it , or if it will create more of a divide amongst individuals who do nt have access to the internet on a daily basis .
yes . exactly . if you are a christian , this is how you should see not just this case , but life in general . famous christians are not better christians or more important christians or more representative of god than any other christian nor do what they do god 's will . except christ , but he 's a special case xd and as stated above , it 's dangerous to start playing that game .
the point is that every so often i get a craving for that book . that specific book . and heaven help me if i ca nt find it , because i will tear the place apart until i do . they re like my comfort food for the brain . they re like popcorn . only made out of paper . and you do nt eat them . okay , so it was a bad metaphor .
exercise i really do like working out once i get into it . it s getting into it that seems to be my current road block . i will do really well for about a week and a half and then fall flat on my face . i know that i feel so much better in so many ways when i exercise . i benefit both mentally and physically . so what in the world is my problem
there are never enough hours in a day , but every now and then , i get to the end of the week and think , wow , i really got a lot done . other times , it s i did nt get anything done all week but you know what it s never enough there s so much more to do , and i have so many more book ideas that i want to write .
anyway , after helping to set up our picnic area by delivering my assigned breakfast foods , chatting with group members , and a quick port a potty trip , i lined up with two of my running buddies who were hoping for the same pace as i was . but , much like many of my runs and races lately , i only managed to keep pace with them for about half a mile or so .
keep right on building yourself up in your inheritance . you live in a world that is full of evil influences . satan would like you to forget the reality of being born again and never realize your place of authority in christ jesus , because if you do , that power you walk in makes you absolutely dangerous to him . he has no defense against you when you walk in the power of god s word
the rapid action treatment cream is also quite gentle despite saying it gives results in hours . i was thinking that for something to work so quickly it would probably have to feel like it was burning your skin off but this cream does n't . it seems to work fast , combined with the wash etc but i 'm not sure if it 's as quick as hours . great thing to keep in your handbag though
some of our children make a wish list for christmas , do yours i never did as a child but i also do n't think my parents could have gone out and just gotten me whatever i wanted with paying for private school for children . our kids know that they may receive something from their list or they may not but they still make them anyway and are always happy and grateful for what they receive .
you ca n't have soup without some sort of bread or roll , here 's a link for irish soda bread and my personal childhood favorite , irish potato bread . now , grandma and i would eat these for breakfast but , growing up , everyone on the farm would just soak up their soup with their leftover bread . so , it 's ingrained in my head somewhere that you have to have bread with soup
depending on the age of your baby , and time you want in diapers full time , part time , day time , etc will vary the amount of diapers you will need to be successful . this kit , which retails for . is enough to get a good part time start for an older baby to toddler who on average will only go through diapers a day , to include overnight . how awesome is that
instead of taking a package tour , why not plan your own vacation . no doubt it is a longer process as you have to do your own research and decide what you want to do within your budget . the good thing for such a plan you are your own boss . wake up as early or late as you wish . this is versus the pain of early wake up calls for a package tour .
scientists have noticed that all cultures developed names for colors in a certain order black , white , red , green , yellow , and blue . basically this means that the colors later in this list were n't identified with names until the colors at the beginning of the list were named . for instance , if a community has a name for green , it will have names for black , white , and red .
first , we have my daughter 's karate . then , one of my friends turned a couple days ago and his wife is throwing him a surprise party today . should be fun lastly , we are heading out near one of my friend 's area to hit their local hockey team . her boys have never been to a hockey game and we thought it would be fun to all go together . ca n't wait
so , here s how this works . please leave a comment , and all those who do will qualify to win georgia 's kitchen by jenny nelson i ll draw the winner on march always two days after i post the daily book , unless it s a weekend , i may allow for more time , and i will post the winner s name at the top of this post , in the highlighted area .
having worked in the care industry for seven years prior to summer it was very rare that i could actually get a bank holiday off unless i bribed . there used to be a process by which you worked one and had the following one off it never actually worked like that though . since last august though i have to get used to having to stay home on bank holidays which does actually feel quite odd sometimes
and here we are our beautiful miracle matthew isaiah has turned years old . every day , hour , minute , second of his life has been precious and a blessing to us . we could nt imagine a day without our matthew with us and pray we never have to we know that we were very blessed that god left him with us . we know this . that is why we are always thankful to god
no one person is like you in every way if i were involved with a guy who was exactly the same as me , i 'd probably get bored really fast so why would i expect someone else to act , be and approach the world in the same way as me i do n't . yet , in relationships with a partner , we often do expect the other person to react the same as we would
the word falling away does not mean falling down but rather taking away . this is talking of the taking away of the christians before the son of perdition satan , the wicked one , the man of sin is revealed . then paul goes on into the verses which i quoted earlier about us being taken out of the way before that wicked one is revealed . paul also writes towards the end of that same chapter
she talks about being in the moment , even if that 's painful or difficult . she encourages being with loneliness and living with suffering rather than trying to escape from it . she talks about giving up hope and accepting that the world being a groundless place . it 's interesting actually , i can see what she means , it makes a lot of sense , although i do n't feel able to explain it .
i do nt know i feel bad for talking like that about her , and it s her business , and her body , not mine . what do you guys think do you push yourself to your limits when you exercise , or do you prefer to go a little easier and if so then why i d like to see the opinions of others , and see if i m the weird one here haha .
you do n't realize how much you could possibly love another person until you have children . i mean , maybe your parents expressed love beautifully and you always knew you were loved . maybe your spouse has never failed to show you how much he loves you . however , you just do n't grasp it until you have a child or children of your own and you know that you would do anything for them .
in the past , i liked to think that i only needed god and his help when things in my life looked grim . that could nt have been farther from the truth . not only was i letting myself believe that i had control of my life and that happiness was completely dependent on me , but i was cheating myself out of true joy that comes with trusting the lord and walking with him daily .
by just doing a few of things , in a much shorter period i earned a lot more miles and flew both my husband and i across the country and back . so it does pay off to make a few different shopping choices in order to earn miles . and certainly , by continuing to shop at the liquor store and buying some of their bonus product offers you will also see the points accumulate faster .
now , here s where i made my mistake . even though our evening plans had changed , my mexican food craving never left me . naturally , i had the bright idea of getting sports stadium quality nachos for dinner . smart , right not only were they gross , they were also expensive , so i felt like i had to eat them . needless to say , my stomach has been upset ever since .
i 'm sure you think i 'm shallow and vain . and maybe i am , but i 'm staring at a big birthday this year . one that i 'll admit i 'm struggling with a bit . the woman looking back at me in the mirror is not the girl i remember being . i 'm trying to remind myself that the lines on my face are proof of a life spent laughing and smiling .
just because you resolve to do something on , it does n't mean that you did jack shit for all of . it does n't mean that you sat on your ass , thinking , no point in do this or that until the new year . it 's a boost in the right direction just one more reason to do the right thing without delay . what have you got against it i honestly do n't understand .
so , i found this mirror in the thrift store , thought it was neat and left . that night i had a dream about what i could do with it , and by morning i was just hoping it was still there . i raced over when it was open and bought it . my daughter was invited to a birthday party , so i decided to make the mirror for her friend . here is the before
we have been married for years and half now but this habit has n't changed and i hope it wo n't change . he is very kind and loving person and my love for him is growing bigger and bigger every day . i am so lucky . even though i love him and appreciate him every day , i think days like valentine 's day is great to remind our self about loves we have around us .
do nt worry i know there are studies out there about everything , we are made to feel guilty about everything that we do . i m sure the fact that i am putting butter and peanut butter onto the toast probably does more harm than taking the crusts off anyway , i ll try and keep the crusts on and will hope that miss f might accidentally bite into them and think that they are actually ok .
also over the break , i realized i forgot a very important item on my best of list going to the new kids on the block backstreet boys concert with my sisters that was one of the best things i did all of last year . we danced , we sang along , we screamed till we lost our voices . and most importantly , i saw jordan knight for the second time in my life . remember this
it would nt be smart for us to go home and wait for labor to progress when the risk of infection was there . in those moments , i was crushed . i really did not want to have our baby in that hospital . i felt like all of the preparation and work i d done over my pregnancy was for nothing and it was a really depressing half hour or so for me . kara left jake
although he 's always up to something like stealing plant pots out of the greenhouse because they are his new favourite toy , it 's really hard to be mad with him at all because he is so cute and also because of his past . as a puppy he 's never been allowed to explore the great outdoors as much as he has since he 's been with us . he 's now at his true home .
when you first start writing you have lots of ideas . then , they start to dry up you use them up or you decide what had seemed good is nt quite as engaging as you d thought . fortunately , as i mentioned the other week , i have the next four or five books planned in my head . still , i m not so teeming with ideas as i was when i decided to be a
well about years ago i had my heart broken . it was nt the first time , but i sure as hell was nt used to it either . i was tired of turning into a complete mess . i was tired of watching my life crumble into pieces yet again . i was sick of feeling the worst pain i had ever felt in my life and promised myself i would never allow it to happen again .
am i fat technically , yes . the number on the scale is higher than i thought it would ever be . i wear it well , and most people do n't know . but it ca n't stay this way . i want to be comfortable in my own skin again . i want my clothes to be too big . i want to feel skinny and sexy again . i want to be healthier and stronger .
my room is not finished yet , i still have to finish my closet , and buy furniture . all of that is so expensive it is also quite difficult because my room is very small , and all my stuff does n't fit , so i 'm going to sell some clothes and makeup again . i do n't really want to show it as of right now . but i will tell you the color ... guess
near the end of the summer , she got hand , foot and mouth disease . that 's quite fun . she 's sick here in this picture . she does n't look so bad , but she was on the couch and did n't move for a long time , let me rock her to sleep , refused to eat for days and was up a lot in the middle of the night miserable from her fever .
i have plenty to show them , but it 's a matter of organizing it all is a way that suitable for presentation . with those five and six year old kids by my side we 've run a marathon of sorts . the starting gun went off in september and the june th finish line is within sight . they have a lot to be proud of and showing it off to their parents is always fun .
many have commented on my physical recovery , saying that i have added years to my life . i do nt know what kind of appointment god has for me regarding my graduation to glory , but this much i know i would rather live a year with this level of freedom and connection to god than twenty years the way i was before when i am consciously connected to it , his love is truly better than life
my husband was nt fond of it when he first tried it . he was nt from the ohio valley , so that was his first mistake . his second mistake was not liking dicarlo s pizza . i could nt wait for him to taste this wonderful thing in a cardboard box . i stared at him , waiting as he bit into its square slice for the very first time . he was quick to judge .
i do praise the person who build this craigslist extension for putting time and effort in making its experience so much better . someone with a passion put time and money into it to make it better , and shared that with the world . nothing else than praise for this person . but , come on , it is pathetic that a tool like craigslist is delivered in a way that these things need to be built .
here is what i thought to be the hardest part of the project covering the cereal boxes with fabric . i wish i could tell you exactly how i did it but it was pretty much trial and error . start by measuring a piece of fabric you know will cover the front and sides of the cereal box . you do n't need to worry about the back because it will be attached to the foam board .
maybe i just feel bad for death , because everyone is scared of the death card , but all it really represents is an ending , and a beginning . things have to end before new things can begin , and for some reason we seem to forget that in order to start over , you have to end . you have to die , if we are taking the analogy all the way . we need death .
then came the electronic possibilities . ebooks were born . and for a while it seemed these ebooks would be the wave of the future and another great source of income just for publishers . actually , most agents would not look at your work , if you published anything and i do mean anything of that book on the web . ebooks looked like they were going to belong to publishers . for a moment in time .
then i made sugar cookies to take to a friend , but , i left them in my car when i got to her house , so , more for me yeah , those hot pink ones oops . i grabbed the bright pink food coloring i used for a pink and turquoise baby shower i threw last year , rather than , ya know , regular pink . they still taste delicious just look a wee funky .
it 's a chest , at least that 's what we call it , it now sits in our living room and acts as a coffee table , desk for the kids to work at , a foot rest when we are watching a film , oh and as it opens the drawers do n't open it also gets used as storage . old furniture may not be everyone 's cup of tea , but i like it .
tonight after visiting with the repair man and getting details of the repair there was no stress . again , there was no resistance to what was . there was no taking the situation personally . i know i used to personalize everything . why is the happening to me would have been my immediate response to something like this . or i might argue , what did i do to deserve this or perhaps this is nt fair
i could make someone s day by simply offering to listen to them . we were put on this earth to serve others . even strangers in a restaurant . what s wrong with introducing oneself to a random stranger and being friendly after leaving for the day , i realized my mistakes . i should have taken these opportunities to reach out to others , even if that is to offer a listening ear to a complete stranger .
it is disappointing to see a club like coventry city in league especially when they were in the top division for a long time but times have changed and the team has nt really looked like returning there anyway . the fans need to stick with the club as they need as much help as they can get and they have a fantastic stadium so i hope they do make a return to the championship as soon as possible .
back to people this week i took photos downtown , walked along the beach , got back into the gym , and generally recovered from the road . it 's good to be back . so now that i 'm officially years and a few days old no break in pace . life goes on . fully lived . much appreciated . and i like to think that there are still lots of interesting pages yet to be written .
anyway , i went off to canadian tire , another hardware store and asked another attendant for help in finding this lamp kit . sure enough , she points me in the right direction and says ' i 'm so glad those days are done for me ' well , it 's good to know i 'm not the only mom who has to help her kids with school work i 'm happy to report i found the lamp kit
thank you . it basically started with the term old soul , meaning someone who is wise beyond their years . i decided that someone who had a bunch of dead people s spirits living inside him might have reason to be considered an old soul . it was something that i did n't think had been done before , or at least if it had been , was n't too common , and it just went from there .
there was no telling how long i stood in the center of the cabin , staring at the books i could n't touch , surrounded by cold and dust and someone else 's life . and his deaths right outside the door . as long as i did n't move , as long as i did n't think about anything but the point right in front of me the spine of a red book i did n't hurt . p.
why did god take his brother away why did her son have to die why did he lose his job why was his father so cruel did she fail as a parent to raise a loving boy why did god create a world in which things can suffer and die the ultimate question in job , the ultimate question in the film , and the ultimate question to modern minds , is why do bad things happen to good people
good . now you ve got some goals some things you know you want to change . but one of the biggest problems for people when setting smart goals is the t time sensitive . they just ca nt answer for themselves one big question when when will you hit that goal by and as they start trying to answer the question of when the excuses and reasons start popping up reason is just code for excuse , right .
apparently , today our beloved doctor asked how we were doing as parents with all that we have to handle . do you guys get away at all he asked my husband . my husband responded that we are trying to get back to regular date nights but we have n't gone away on an overnight in a while . doctor awesome responded by gently encouraging my husband to make it happen , which he was very open to .
my son will just die if he does nt get a soda each week . at least that s how he acts about it . but i m happy to see that he s motivated . he does nt get to drink soda at home and very rarely at restaurants , so i have no gripes about it , as long as he does nt have the opportunity to down it just before i pick him up from school .
my goal for the palestinian people would be to live in peace , to live in prosperity , to have the dignity of a state , to have freedom . and they can achieve it any morning they are prepared to say israel has a right to exist , we give up the right to return , and we recognize that we re going to live side by side , now let s work together to create mutual prosperity .
a couple of days later , i was introduced to my african american niece , nephew and more cousins . who knew i even had them i certainly did nt i learned about what schools they attend , what languages they study , what sports they like , what goals they have in life . phone numbers and e mail addresses were exchanged . there was laughter , tear soaked eyes and hugs that felt more and more natural .
it is time to wake up folks , these are the birth pains . the lord is rich in mercy and desires that no one should reject him and damn themselves to eternal torment . he loves you , he died for you , and he wants you to come to him and have fellowship with him . if you have never before asked the lord into your life , all you have to do is pray something like this
it 's not a superpower at all . i would like to be able to play the piano again . i miss playing it but i dare n't sit at it . i never learnt how to read music , nor was i ever interested in doing so . ear was what led me to the blacks and whites and i hope one day to recover that super power again and be guided to the piano by my ear .
i studied really hard during my days as a student . i was the class president in elementary school and vice chairman of the student body . i was also vice chairman in junior high school but i stopped after i got cast in the company because it felt too pressuring . i did nt rely on earning votes through my looks or anything . i think they voted for me because i was a model student , haha .
dave comes to chicago , we remember why we love each other , we decide that being together could never work , we break up , dave leaves , we miss each other , he returns , we break up , we spend a holiday in france , we go to england , we break up . in between , we call each other and have phone sex and cry . for a year we go on like this .
i suppose it is inevitable that as the world 's population grows beyond all reasonable levels it becomes harder and harder to ever have a truly original idea . i like to think that many of the ideas in my work in progress , a sci fi thriller set in the near future , are original . i 've never heard of them or seen them anywhere , and i 'm quite proud of coming up with these ideas .
. be serious about what you do , but do nt take yourself too seriously humor can provide needed relief when times get tough . what many fail to understand is sometimes in order to find the humor you actually have to look for it . if you want others to take you seriously , the first thing you need to do is to get over yourself . the most important barrier to overcome is the barrier of self .
over my car 's radio yesterday morning i caught the end of an interview with an author talking about her husband 's aphasia and recovery from it . as i drove into the target parking lot the women were still talking , and i had n't heard any names of books or people yet , so i sat in the car a little longer , digging around in my purse to find a tiny black notebook to write in .
kids who want to use drugs will figure out a way to get around these tactics . kids who are n't using drugs will feel like criminals if we treat them as such . maybe your best bet is to drop your weapons , and approach your child in a peaceful way . if you want more than just random reassurance that your child is not on drugs , try taking the advice of another expert from the same article
central park is a god send i got to spend a few hours in central park , exploring while jogging around the park . for those runners or not who have never been , it s a must do . there is so much within the park , especially if you have kids or like outdoor activities . and it s all free i could have stayed there all day , both days . stupid work gets in the way
a they might not want to admit it , but when i was there , my goodness , people were saying , are we really snake bit are we really cursed doubts and talks like that came about . everybody just tried to brush it to one side and remain positive , but it was hard to escape because everybody was talking about it . it 's hard to argue when it keeps happening year after year after year .
how am i meant to stay positive when he refuses to give an inch first i was nt allowed to talk about babies because we were nt in a place for them . i was nt allowed to talk about them because i was nt pregnant yet . now i m not allowed to talk about them because its too early . what s going to be the excuse when i start showing or when the baby is actually here
online discount deals lets anyone get to find and enjoy these amazing offer at no extra efforts . these discount deals are made for all at same . there are various types of products like beauty , food , clothes cosmetics therapy and generally other daily deals things . every day these discount deals are offered by numbers of sites to the customers . sometime some people are failing to find out where these deals are being offered at .
however , i am unsure of these are made for heavy use and when you multiply them by legs on multiple chairs chairs that i love but not worth spending too much on it becomes more than i want to put into these particular chairs . so , if you know of any options i am not thinking of for these legs please let me know . i would love to be able to use the chairs if possible .
i realize that it may not be realistic to eat organic food of the time . but at least now you have some food for thought j . my experience is that it is something that you must grow into . what has worked for my family is a commitment to organic food of the time . once you can prove to yourself that you can feel the difference than you can grow into eating organic food more often .
we had a great new year 's eve celebration with my parents . we did quite a bit , but kept it low key . we started off by going to church in frankfort got ta love that catholic saturday night mass . it was so nice to be back at the church where we got married we are n't able to go often because it 's in northern michigan , so it makes it special when we can .
james on the other hand , he had his fair share of women problems , never being able to keep in a relationship for more than a few months . definitely for not more than a year . he changed his women more times than he changed his job . his last break up was a hard one , especially because she had just left him for his best friend . it felt like he could nt catch a break .
i did get a little crafting done the day after christmas . i 've had this box for a year and i knew what i wanted to do with it as soon as i got it , but i just had n't taken the time . it was painted blue and cream and had light houses painted all over it . so i took it to the garage and painted the oval box white and the lid a flat black .
we are getting about eggs a day now from the girls . i have enjoyed these little gals so much . they are quite friendly and they seem to enjoy my company too . when i get home from work they all rush to the fence to say hello . actually i think they are saying let us out we only let them out on the weekends . the rest of the time they have to stay in their yard .
for those of you that know me , know that i 've always wanted to be a mom . i use to carry around my babies pretending they were real . it was rare to see me without one of them attached to my hip . so needless to say when matthew and i found out we were pregnant , i was on top of the world my dream was coming true , i was finally going to be a mommy
that same day i was meeting a friend of mine for some thrift store shopping . on the way an old abandoned , shady looking hotel bar that sits right on the edge of the colorado river caught my eye . i have passed this particular place many times before and have always found it intriguing but this particular day i took the time to seek out the name of it so i could do a little research on it .
our apartment is now my apartment . it would seem two lives would continue on in our place , but it appears there s now only one life , my life in my apartment . it s always helpful in the illusion of verisimilitude to make sure that a left handed character on page stays left handed on page . when you re in character , try and remember that your character is married , and do nt slip up .
our son and daughter in law have been married years . they started out the vision of a young married couple . she finished her college degree while he established himself in his own business . they bought a house , cars , fun toys and vacationed . they gave themselves time to mature while getting to know each other . then the day came , like most young couples experience , and the decision to have children was made .
i know it s so often said that you never know what you have until you lose it , but death certainly has presented that to me . i received a call tuesday evening informing me that my grandmother was in the hospital after suffering two heart attacks and the chances of her survival were practically nothing . after taking her off life support the next day , her heart stopped almost immediately and the world lost a wonderful soul .
i love that tony is the iron man , that the suit is a part of him , that he can take it off but he never stops being iron man . copying the suit like that turns the iron man into exactly what i always thought he was just a suit . suddenly the man inside does not matter anymore and that , is a shame . a sad , foolish ending , to an otherwise well told story .
this book could easily be taken for another fluffy coffee table offering though not in coffee table format . i read it from cover to cover in around minutes , but it is clearly not meant to be speed read . it is more like a meditative poem to the beauty of living , than a guide book . taken in small sections , as a daily meditative practice , it may be able to do just what it claims .
we spent the last day however , in a small village and decided to take it easy and just relax , sit out in the sun , read a book , eat and basically do nothing . i found that years and years of life in fast pace had me quite uncomfortable with a contrarian lifestyle like this , which was amusing , surprising and a bit disturbing . i need a few more of those days in my life .
for now i guess i 'll have to settle for the occasional phone call , email , and instant messages and he 'll have to get my hugs in the way of gifts for his new place , like food . i know he 'll make the right choices so i have already arranged for him to visit his local farmers market and trader joe 's to pick up the foods we used to enjoy together before the big move .
this part is tricky with chicken breast meat . what you want to do is cook it with a little vegetable oil at medium heat until just when you stop seeing any pink . this will mean the meat is almost done , but not quite . remove it from heat and let it sit . it will be the last thing to go into the chili , just before it is done . it should now look something like this
day i receive a tidy rejection email . it does nt hurt as much as i thought it would , just a little sting like a shot in the arm . the quick turn around time is more surprising . was it so bad they did nt need to spend much time on it or it was so good they wanted to get back to me right away out of respect i pretend not knowing the answer to this question .
i found it very hard to see what was written in my exercise books and on the blackboard . i had to sit in the front row so that i could see what the teacher was writing . i was feeling a little scared at the time . i knew that there was something wrong with me but i did n't want anyone to know . i was hoping it would just be a temporary thing and it would pass .
are you considering becoming a real estate salesperson in singapore do you want to venture into the property market and deal with real estate do you want to explore a new career option if your answer is yes to any of these questions , then you will need to know two essential things about joining the real estate industry a how much does it costs to enter the industry and b how long does it take to become certified salesperson .
it 's good to believe in something . if non christians feel so strongly about what they believe in that it 's worth standing up for and fighting christians about , it means they believe in something else , but still they believe . the problem i have is that at a time like this white people are still more focused on fighting about religion than about seriously discussing what we are being faced with . it baffles the mind .
there are certain places where you wo n't get photographs that satisfy you and that the experience is worth more than taking the perfect picture . you need to find the balance with this and decide when you take the photograph and when you enjoy the experience . learn to also trust yourself and know you 've gotten that photograph , and it 's time to put the camera away . that 's part of the evolution as a photographer .
now , i do nt believe that every person should go to college . some people are not cut out for it and they would prefer to do jobs that do nt require a college degree . but they will still usually need some sort of training or education in order to find a job that will allow them to live above the poverty line . while that is not true in all cases , it is true in many .
we 're really excited because it 's been a few weeks because of the holidays . stores did n't have much in the way of sales , so that was kind of a bust . that 's one of the things about living in a small town . but , hey , if that 's all there is to complain about , boy we 're doing pretty darn good doing pretty darn good anyway you look at it he he he
would it kill you , to show a bit of encouragement i called her up last night , after i had decided that i simply could not deal with it , any more . it was some time near pm . she was in the house , just a football field away . and , i am pretty sure she was getting ready to go to sleep . did it even cross your mind , to show a little support .
i do n't know if i can accurately describe max . my vet told me he had more character than any cat he 's ever seen . anyone who spent time around max loved him . you had to . he did n't give you a choice . if you sat down , you were petting him , and your lap now became his . you could toss him down times , and times , he would jump right back up .
the second issue is that singer writes this essay as if he is so completely right . that there is no way you could ever argue with his philosophy or logic . he is so self assured and , i suppose , that a man who has written so many books that are widely recognized and read and a man who has taught in huge colleges and universities , might have cause to feel self assured about his logic and philosophies .
i m in touch with lots of area authors who are going to write posts here . but i do nt know everybody , so if you , too , are an author with a book coming out , or if you d like to write a guest post , or if you re connected to any book related event , leave me a message in the comments . do nt be shy self published authors are welcome here , too .

also , if you have another minute or so , please check out the link below . the local cable news station , cn , did a short video feature based on a recent front page story that ran in usa today about us . our picture was featured on page , above the fold , and talked about how we sold our house at slightly below market in order to move into our continuing life community here in rock hill .
that being said , please note that in a couple of weeks , we will be starting some guided reading . for those of you unsure what guided reading looks like , i have attached a clip from a classroom where guided reading is being conducted in a small group setting . this may give you some insight into how to help your child out at home when those reading packets come home . hope you find it helpful . happy reading
learn about how broad social media marketing is if you want to use it correctly . social media marketing allows you to get a better grasp about the types of customers visiting your business . they might even interact with you directly and provide you with feedback about your brand . you will , of course , have the opportunity to talk about your products , but it s better to think about social networking as a form of customer relations .
regionals is an all day event . based on how you play for your morning matches will determine which division you end up in for the afternoon . it was a really painful morning . several painful matches , followed my more painful matches . did i mention it was painful we were really disappointed in outcome because they were put in a really easy division that they took st place in because no one could really hit in that level .
now many would see the statement as anti corporation . it is not , it is just pro people like me who have no control over price rise and who do not grow any food . one does not wishes to be arm twisted in paying more money . there are already so many problems in india regarding the present situation of land grab , such policies would just aggravate the situation . the farmers are already suffering from different quarters .
ages ago , when i was a young newspaper reporter , writing was mostly a one way process . occasionally i d write a story and someone would call to yell at me , or more happily , someone would send a thank you note . but mostly i felt distant from my readers in those pre internet days . perhaps my favorite thing about blogging is the opportunity to see which posts people are reading and to get immediate feedback .
she recently mentioned that she 'd thrown a book party for her husband 's first novel , the variations , which i immediately ordered . i wondered what kind of tough man could be married to this over the top woman . i discovered that he had written another book a few years ago called ambivalence , a love story portrait of a marriage . not fiction as we have it but a memoir and a beautifully written memoir at that .
i was making lots of cupcakes that day and was n't sure what cake flavor would taste best so i did half of them lemon cake and half rainbow chip . i liked both , but i think they were best with the rainbow chip or white . others who were there can also weigh in if you like heat oven to degrees . prepare cake batter as directed on package and put in the fridge while you prepare the filling .
as one who tries to keep up with what s going on in the world , especially the world of humans as they interact with the environment , i check out the sierra club s monthly magazine column up to speed from time to time . in that column they list some of the more notable things going on around the world that affect us all . let s start with the bad news in the latest edition of the magazine .
the bike was on the other end waiting for the response of my injury . the bike had two small children , a man with specs and a woman that appeared to be his wife . people gathered and planned to act against the man in the bike . i convinced them that i was fine and let the man go as he is with his family . soon the people took my bike up and made me relax and went .
the only bad part of the morning for me was picking up a black garbage bag in an abandoned lot that had snakes under in it . i had to shake out the two that were still in the bag , and later found a very small dead snake in a different spot . i was so grateful it was only outside , as the snakes were barely moving because they were so cold and there were small , but still snakes
several months ago , i wrote down a poem in my notebook thinking that one day i might want to post it . i would look at it from time to time , but the right time never seemed to appear . i liked the poem , yet i had questions about it . i looked at it again a few days ago . still not the right time . well , unfortunately , today seems to be the right day .
with time i reached the age where i did n't care what people thought . i learned to question every bit of wisdom and advice thrown my way . imagine , all those years , all that rubbish and i had no clue . television , like all things , has a value which is determined by the individual . the aesthetic and psychological value are hard to pin down but , like anything , it is a source of knowledge .
i got myself into trouble , by getting pregnant as a teen , and i really had to grow up faster than anyone else . being a teen mum , well it was far from easy , i had to find a job and juggle school after the children s father left me . i was pregnant with our second child , james . and still , i would nt pray , i was still being stubborn , by being mad .
all of us have noticed the big push from health care as of late and have read pages upon pages of tactics that they list and publish , to try and push vaccines on the total population . so is it any surprise that they are trying to change laws in order to make it more difficult to say no of course it is nt and neither is it a surprise that they will make more money because of this new bill .
twitter is meant for socializing which means the majority of your stream should either be about them or about us . this means that you want to have more two way communications and also to tweet information that will be beneficial for them as well . having a stream that is all about me is not going to be as popular , and less people will likely want to follow . they will get tired of being sold to all the time .
perhaps that is why for all of us , once we learn of such a team we ca nt help but love this very idea . the idea that these heroes exist in the same shared universe and fight side by side to take on the foes that they can face alone . it reminds us all that we live in a much larger world and that we must stand together to fight the foes that we ourselves ca nt face alone .
to develop the story , tony thought long and hard about the big bad wolf . my way of finding the big idea is to think very very hard about the character who they are and what they want . really great stories are the ones that grip you . you encounter the character , you are gripped by the character s problem , how is he going to solve it you can say at any one time what does that character want
french september 's goal is to get her writing a bit each day in french . it can be just a decent sized paragraph , but she has to get writing in french . she reads a ton in english and writes a ton in english , even though french is her first language . i would not forgive myself if i let her french slide to the point that she will finish school not feeling capable of reading and writing in french
now that i , your lord and teacher , have washed your feet , you also should wash one another s feet . i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you . very truly i tell you , no servant is greater than his master , nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him . now that you know these things , you will be blessed if you do them . john
with three kids and a husband that works long hours and most nights , i am a pretty busy woman . most days get away from me and then i realize it is and i have n't given a single thought to what i will feed the children for dinner . although i love to cook and make elaborate meals , it does n't happen very often since my time is rationed and the boys eat like birds most of the time .
the town did a wonderful job of keeping town folk informed with ' code red ' phone calls . local radio stations get my ' thumbs down ' for not getting critical update on the air , only playing ' happy ' music with an overly ' bright and shiny ' enthusiastic dj that never seemed to look out his window and let us , who had no other means of gathering information but the radio , know what was going on .
and that s because despite everything else , i find a way to regularly keep it organized . do nt get me wrong i may slip up and have too many black shoes at one time is there really such a thing , but i definitely have a distinct method of cleaning out my shoe closet and keeping it organized . you may decide to tweak some of these , but at the very least it may be a starting off point .
from where i sit , business development is an everyday activity . everyday as in days a year . you see , the competition for new business gets harder and harder every year . if you truly want to grow your practice you have to work at it . you have knock on doors , attend events and work your referral network . the days of sitting back and waiting for business to beat a path to your door are long gone .
i 'd like to start this post with an apology to my alarm clock . it took quite the beating this morning , in the still dark hour of six am i have n't seen that time of day in two weeks , and it was quite the shocker . i enjoyed every second of winter break , at home with my kids . i 've only been at work for a few hours , and i already miss them and my house
the world is used to bad news and always has been , but now and then there occurs something so brutal , so outside the normal limits of what used to be called man s inhumanity to man , that you have to look away . then you force yourself to look and see and only one thought is possible this must stop now . you wonder , how can we do it and your mind says , immediately whatever it takes .
ever have one of those moments where your mind just goes blank and the rest of you goes blank no other thought existed in my head except for the i have to listen to that song . so i found it on spotify . and i played it . it took me back to a time when a certain french canadian boy introduced me to such music . i still know the lyrics to this song . and i do n't speak french
i 've been working on several sewing projects and some craft projects for the nursery . i just got a new camera for when the baby comes , so when i figure out how to upload the pictures onto the computer i 'll be sure to post . until then , thank you for reading this blog post up to this point . sorry if it was boring , but i 'm glad to have gotten everything down i 've been thinking .
hey everybody ..... this week has been crazy busy . i have had time to only pull up my computer at school , come home , eat dinner work on school stuff , go to bed and then do it again the next day . i have currently pulled saturday work days at school so that i can get stuff ready and going . it is crazy . i know this first year i am practically going to live at the school .
but today , well this was it . this was what i always wanted . i wanted the chance to call on her , and for her to respond . i think she wanted to the chance to be needed . and we both wanted the opportunity to prove that no matter the time or years that have passed , no matter the lack of knowledge we have about how to play out our roles , we are still mother and daughter .
it 's november now , which mean christmas is less than two months away , which in turn means that it is time to start working on homemade gifts . i thought that it would be fun to share some things that i 've made for gifts . sounds like i good idea , right well , there 's a catch ... most of what i 'll be sharing is from last year , and i 'm just now posting them . ha
why this works for me starting early takes the pressure off . if i m working on a reading guide at eight oclock the night before it s due , i wo nt do a very good job , and i probably wo nt learn much . if i start on it at two oclock on a sunday , i am free to do a good job , and because i m not stressed , i have a better time doing it .
as a great moment of faith , ended with jesus asking peter , why did you doubt i do nt believe jesus was being hard on him . i think he really wanted to encourage peter that he was , and can do the impossible it just takes keeping our eyes on him so we give no place for the enemy to bring doubt and unbelief . we know that those are the weapons the enemy uses to keep us double minded and
i do n't remember the last time i was so happy to see his face . he was fine . he did n't seem the least bit upset . the first thing he said was , mom , your crying oh , if he only knew how afraid i had been . i picked him up and carried him back to where our stuff was , despite him asking me to put him down . i did n't want to let go .
our children are growing up in a selfish world where they need to be entertained every second . relationships tend to get lost in the pace of their our lives . i am trying , in small ways surely , to teach them that it 's not about them . it is not an easy thing to do , but i hope today it opened up a little window for them to see what they are missing right in front of them .
today is the day my free block of the month quilt design is officially launched thank you to everyone who entered my poll to see whether you wanted the quilt to be revealed now , or month by month . of the people who voted , said they wanted to see the complete quilt right at the beginning . that is an overwhelming response , so , close your eyes and scroll down if you do n't want to see it all now
probably three quarters of my patterns are for dresses . while i do wear dresses almost every day i 'm not sure i need another thirty something dresses in my wardrobe to add to the ones i already have . so , i 'm going to make a rule . for every vintage pattern i want to buy i have to get rid of one from my collection . hopefully , this will mean i can keep it to a manageable size .
it was also my first try at hand quilting a quilt . i love the look and how it turned out , so i 'm sure that i 'll give it another try on a future quilt . for me , that 's what 's great about these swap groups . it gives me a chance to try out a new technique or idea on a small project and i get to make someone else happy with something made especially for them .
i forget things all the time . it 's rare that i walk out of the house without having to run back in to grab something i forgot . just a few weeks ago , i walked out without my keys , but i did remember to bring my kids , and to lock the door behind me . i found myself outside in the cold with no keys for the car , and no way to get back into the house .
by the time rolled around , i was ready to just crawl in bed with a sleeve of thin mints and call it a night . but the next best thing was to at least get out of the house for a bit , no matter what state i was in . so naturally i ended up seeing the person i least wanted to see . the who , what and why s are not important , but it was not pleasant .
well this needed to be addressed , so i pulled out after the guy and stopped him just after he went around my other officers and the car that they were pushing . one of those officers had tried to flag him down , but he drove right past that officer , too . i got him to stop about half a block down . needless to say , i was not in the best of moods when i approached the driver .
so then i m talking to my brother on the telephone . he answers my call with his name . i tell him who i am but he does nt know me at all . it was like i d looped back to some kind of parallel reality . another universe . but somehow my going back worked out a whole bunch of issues that needed to be resolved . all very strange . would have made a good sci fi story .
sometimes i think i have to do something grand in order for it to be worthwhile or noticed . sometimes i feel overwhelmed because i do n't know where i will get the time , the means , or the idea for what i should do . sometimes i wonder if the little things done daily really matter or if every day should be something fabulous . and then i ruminate about the idea that maybe the little things are the grand things .
a babies first birthday party has quite a lot of meaning for everyone involved . for the parents , it s a huge relief that they survived the first year . for the child , they really do nt understand what s going on except they got to get really messy and eat something that tastes really sweet and nummy . for the grandparents , their life has come full circle with a grandchildren and watching them grow is just pure joy and bliss
many of us sit down to write an inventory and tell everything that happened to us . how we were done wrong and why every bad thing that ever happened is someone else s fault . as we progress through step five , we find that the focus is not on others but on ourselves . after years of lying to ourselves and everyone we knew , our freedom is found in honestly taking responsibility for our own motivations , behaviors and patterns .
i had not . it was the worst kind of limbo . although i loved every single minute i lived in japan , i was eager to start the next chapter of my life in my true calling . teaching english was fun , and i made a really good living doing it , but it did n't feed my soul . i felt like i needed a job that did . and a master 's that would allow me to do so .
since i m in the song writing mood i ve been listening to myself . what i mean by that is when i m talking to someone i actually think about what i m saying in case it might make some good lyrics . the other day i was talking to my friend and then in mid conversation i said hey that d make awesome lyrics and starting writing it down on my phone . my friend thought i was a little weird .
it 's funny , but you or at least i look back at your life and see the blessings and challenges that each year held first full time job at , married at , baby at , finished graduate degree at , baby at , back surgery at . thirty four is starting off this way . hopefully , i 'll be able to look back and see that this was n't the defining moment , even if it feels that way now .
she had too many of those times written in the lines of her face . back then , we had all the immortality of youth and we thought we could go on forever . time happens to all of us though , mostly while we are nt looking . turn away for a moment and when you turn back you find years have slipped by and the face that looks back at you from the mirror has become the face of your parent .
thank you for your quick response . i see that your favorite animal is the dog . are you sure that it s your favorite i have never seen a dog before so i went online and researched it some more . look at the pictures of the dogs attached to this email . how could you like those things and when you look at the cat picture , you can clearly see that the cat is a superior being to the dog .
my parents confirmed it as well . they were looking after him and my father who has seven children and was an er nurse thought we might want to bring him to the hospital . but by that time things were getting bad , even so that i could tell this was a problem . i remember watching him sleep , stop breathing , chest rising in a futile struggle to get air , until he woke himself up enough to breathe again .
but i passed over our doggy bag , and we all turned to look at the eight year old boy 's face . and his little brother , bright shining cheeks , aged around four , racing as fast as his four year old legs could carry him , through the traffic towards the cooling chips . how it made me ashamed . children , younger than ours , who do n't have enough to eat , in our bit of our town .
i can not count the times i called my sister and said , how about going to lunch in a half hour she would gas up and stammer , i ca nt . i have clothes on the line . my hair is dirty . i wish i had known yesterday , i had a late breakfast , it looks like rain and my personal favorite it s monday . she died a few years ago . we never did have lunch together .
i encourage you no matter what happens in your life praise god , good or bad because god , has a plan and the trials will help you trust god , more as well grow closer to him , as long you do nt get mad at god , for things not going your way remember it s no longer your way it s god s , way and it s god s timing he has no desire to harm you through these trials
i just finished watching a film called the lost boys of sudan and i m not really sure where to begin . i think i m just going to make a list of thoughts i had during the film because , as much as i hate lists , there simply is nt any other way for me to do this right now . i ll need to give my thoughts some time to simmer before i m capable of any other kind of response
to her with a natural approach to anything in my life , she pretty much laughs in my face . that simple act manages to really discourage me pretty easily . i think , of the facts are there , the facts are there . if it makes me feel good , and is not dangerous , they why not i do n't think because my mom says so is a good enough excuse as an adult to do or not do anything .
why the heck would someone who does n't eat meat , and is repulsed by it , give a good god damn about the meat dishes what we want to know is how the vegetarian dishes are . if we ask , ok , but how is the vegetarian food there , and you say , i do n't know , we do n't have to eat vegetarian food so we 've never ordered it , please consider what you are really saying .
the other day we were eating chicken with rice . many times we have steak with rice and we serve it with soy sauce . so abby asked for soy sauce with her chicken and rice . then she kept saying that she wanted black chicken . we could not figure out what she wanted but finally decided that black chicken meant that she wanted steak . we were all laughing except for abby who was disappointed that she could n't have black chicken
a father and his five year old daughter head out to a basketball court at the local playground . he carries his regulation ball on his hip . she rolls her kid sized version in front of her , occasionally kicking it to keep it moving . when they reach the court , the father shoots a couple of shots while his daughter proceeds to dribble her ball around the court with two hands . after a few minutes , the daughter says ,
ladies your cards are amazing thank you so much for sharing your talent with us watch for your cards to be added to our slide show and be sure to grab your top three blog badge from the side of our blog to display with pride on your blog and if you would like to be a guest design team member on a future challenge , and get the sponsor 's images to design a card with , just send me an email .
i 've been looking back on some blog posts from and i 'm amazed at myself . in some areas , i 've really come a long way . in other areas , i see that i really did n't move or change at all . i 'm kind of blah about that , not sure what i can really say other than i'm human , so sue me . ok , no really do n't sue me . i 'm quite broke .
you . are . the . job . professional distance is a biggie . just as you can expect french friends to take longer to warm up to you , your colleagues may not give you the welcome you expect from day one . in france , people probably wo n't ask you how your kids are , wait , in fact , most do nt give a rat 's ass if you have a family and probably prefer you not mention it .
we are the servants god is the master . we tend to try to reverse this god 's revelation of himself , his purposes , and his ways depends directly upon our obedience . he may not reveal today his intentions for the next five years , but he will tell us what our next step should be . as we respond to god 's revelation , he will accomplish what he desires , and he will be the one who receives the glory .
i want to cry for him , the fact that his friends make fun of him for smelling or for being a baby . when i took him into the preschool he is in i walked in and said hi i am looking for a place for my almost year old son she said no problem we have room . and i literally cried and said one thing though , he 's not potty trained and she said no problem and i cried harder .
are you feeling overwhelmed or discouraged by circumstances in your life are you forgetting what god has already done for you in these tough economic times it is hard sometimes to keep looking up . we need to shut the news off and let god speak to us his good news as christians we are not allowed to give up . god has so much he wants to do through those times of weakness . let your strength and hope be in the lord .
during all of the driving and waiting involved in this trip my mother and i were reading many books . she was on her kindle reading the hunger games trilogy and i was reading various things on mine . she was happy because she finished the second book and was able to download the third book and keep right on reading without too much hassle . she paid or so dollars for her book . my books were less , they were all . .
yes , my adult novel was awarded a mentor through the scottish arts council mentoring scheme . this was another great learning curve . i was involved in a four month mentoring process helping to knock my novel into shape . it is called cry wolf and i am seeking agent representation . i am also writing a novel called woman with a letter in her hand based on the life of my grandmother . i do see myself writing for adults and children .
i did have a reason for it . i think sometimes , our society focuses too much on winning and losing . isabel gets to travel to new york city for the contest , which is a dream come true for her . the contest is really just icing on the cupcake . see what i did there huh do you pretty clever , right so , i left it up to the reader 's imagination as to what happened at the baking contest .
last week while visiting with our daughter and her family for thanksgiving , christy and i were again discussing a book that she claims has changed my life . in the course of this conversation , she made a statement that has not left me . she said , there is no way a person can read this book and not be changed , if they have a servant 's heart . she does by the way . but i immediately thought , do i
somewhere a bit beyond the age of ten , i began to take more interest in my wardrobe , and the correlations of how this would affect what i thought my image was in public . both of my younger sisters had begun doing this a long time ago , so perhaps girls start doing that sooner than boys . i think some begin as early as a year old , but perhaps a few of you might think it s earlier than that .
friendship begins with us . we have to act like one to have one , right this is a fact . i know it s hard for somebody out there to be friendly . but for once , try to be one . i assure you that you will never regret it . yes for now , you re happy , but let s face the reality , can you maintain your happiness forever being alone no so you need someone to be happy .
i did get the call yesterday you are probably asking , what call the call from l l yard goods saying they were starting their buck a block . the first blocks were ready to pick up as well as the finishing kits . so i had to hurry down there yesterday to pick that up . i have n't started on them yet , there are each month , because i am still working on those log cabin blocks . getting closer though .
when i eat too much sugar , everything in my body hurts . pretty much chris ca n't hug me right now . it sucks . and it is my own fault . chris took some of the leftover treats to work today , so hopefully that will help me kick this crap out of my system and not keep eating it . we do still have half a cake and some other goodies left though ... must . have . self . control .
and , last , but certainly not least , my hubby , captain america . he 's just fantastic . i love him more than i can say . he 's wonderful with our children , and truly loves them . he wants to see them succeed , and will do what it takes to help them learn and be happy . he gives of himself to his family , his church , and his country . he 's my hero love you , babe
i started this book almost a year ago . then in october i had my laptop stolen . it was n't backed up it is now and i lost every last bit of work i 'd done on the book . i started making my notes again from scratch on th october . i sent the book off on st march . i hope i never have to work to that kind of timetable again , but i think i got away with it .
my heart s been healed for a very long while now , and i m happy to say that we keep in touch from a distance from time to time . i m glad to see pictures of him smiling on facebook . i will always think he s a wonderful person and i ll always wish happiness for him . i grew a lot in those three plus years we spent together but i grew even more in learning to let him go .
it was also surprising to me the range of opinions that were represented . i certainly did not agree with all of them , but i recognize that everyone has a right to their opinion , and a right to be heard . it is my hope and prayer that , in the end , right decisions will be made for our country . it was fun to be a part of the process . why did i wait so many years to get involved
i know , some of you are reading this and thinking , where can i get some of this stuff do nt be swayed by the lie that i was told , because that is what it is . let s walk through this for a moment and examine the two messages i received . the first one told me that i was connected to everything else in the universe , that we were all one , and that there was nothing to fear .
just some easy tweaks and you will begin to start making better food choices , eat less food overall and guess what you ll even enjoy exercise . all of these things combined will lead you to that slim , fit and healthy body that at the moment seems a long way off . but the good news is now you are aware of what you need to do to get it and all you have to do is reach out and grab it .
so here we are , having not gotten a challenge out on time for a couple of days and there s that huge temptation to throw up my hands and call it a day . writing can be like that . we have a great idea , get seven chapters into the story and stop for whatever reason , only to find out that later on we have no momentum , and ca nt even remember how the next scene was supposed to go .
but see , i am an idiot at least when it comes to tools and fixing stuff and guy stuff . and you know what i 'm okay with that . i have no desire to learn . i like being in the kitchen and doing girl stuff . i 'm perfectly fine with letting a knight in shining armor take care of that stuff while i sit back and admire him . hey , it 's my fantasy i can pretend such men exist .
we must learn how to develop technology that is not only built for quicker processing , ease of access , and multitasking , but also built with our body and health in mind as well . we must not only keep our bodies fit , but also our minds . if we get too connected to technology , in situations where we are unable to use it such as it being broken , under maintenance , or out of reach we will be completely lost .
last night emma 's school hosted a family movie night in the auditorium . from the moment i picked emma up from school until we left for the house emma asked if we could go . of course she did n't mention that it was last night until about minutes before we needed to be there . i figured since dave was stuck at work why not . so we rushed around to get our shoes and coats on and out the door we went .
some people just hate the thought of a traditional cardio workout and yoga allows you to go slow and move at your own pace . if you are interested in learning more about the history of yoga , there are many resources on the internet that can help you learn how to practice a much older form of yoga . you may find that there are many things that you can learn about yoga and maybe even incorporate these new findings into your daily life .
actually , i do nt have a sense of needing anything personally . i ve learned by now to be quite content whatever my circumstances . i m just as happy with little as with much , with much as with little . i ve found the recipe for being happy whether full or hungry , hands full or hands empty . whatever i have , wherever i am , i can make it through anything in the one who makes me who i am .
next my mother has suffered quite a bit through the past months without energy and in and out of the hospital . finally the decision was made to insert a pacemaker , and it has made all the difference . i am so happy to report that her energy level is up and she is doing much better . this pacemaker thing is really a miracle . now , if only we could control her blood sugar better , but one thing at a time .
one of the problems i think we have in schools is that we train students to fear failure , to avoid it at all costs . now , to be clear , i 'm not suggesting you go out and fail all your classes . but i am suggesting that you should take some risks in your learning . that instead of avoiding things that are hard because you might fail , you challenge yourself to step up and take on things that are difficult .
everyday , though , i wake up and realize i 'm infertile and that i 've lost something . everyday i have to deal with the anger and make a choice about what i am going to do with it . i 'm constantly depending on god for help in this area . sometimes i am bitter . all the emotions can come and go depending on where i am and what i 'm faced with and i make a choice on how i respond .
my year old was in tears doing homework last night , at the table doing homework . he was supposed to think of times in the past that were fun . well , he burst into tears and said that all of the fun times were with his dad , and that he did n't realize how much he was going to miss him when he went away . poor tom . i just let him talk about it , and get his tears out .
at the risk of sounding even older than i am , let me say that there are things i miss about the good old days of my youth . yes , life had its trials back then , too , and especially having just finished reading the help,i realize that being white and growing up in the s and s was a whole different experience than my black friends had . but , still , there are by gone things that i miss . for example
if i could sum up korean service to you , i would have to emphasize the attention to detail and respect for the customer . show interest in a certain product you get free samples of similar ones . need something gift wrapped for free a professional could nt do a better job . look even a bit lost and confused someone will be there for you in a matter of moments . and you can always expect a friendly hello and goodbye every time .
this is a board i made for the living room . i 've since changed my mind on a few things , but i still want the same feel for the room . i absolutely love this color palette and i think my two green chairs are going to look fabulous in the space . i have already purchases some amazing art for behind the couch , but i would love to paint an abstract piece like this one for somewhere else in the apartment .
but friendship is a funny thing . two kids can meet on a beach , on a playground or at the park and become the best of friends for that moment even if they most likely wo n't ever cross paths again . however , there are other times when one little girl or boy can have a tough time knowing how to make friends because they ca n't quite figure out how to find that one little connection that would bring two kids together .
for the record , i have n't yet decided whether to leave seven at . . i am firmly on the as many readers as possible side of the question and the lower sales for seven do n't sit well with me . however , i did put out a collection of four of my books for . . i actually earn more from one sale of the collection than from selling each of the books individually , and the reader pays less . win win
he did great he seemed to enjoy the activity wanted to stay longer and take more pictures but we were out of time . he ll deny later that he enjoyed it or said any of that but he did . it was only a short trip . it had taken us a while to leave the house someone did nt like any of his socks and i had nt planned to stay for long anyway , not knowing how the outing would turn out .
i re read my post from january , . i knew that new year 's eve was really painful , but i forgot just how bad it was and how much i cried . that i carried his bear around and cried over and over again . it was only months since jacob was born too , so that made it a lot harder . i 'm so glad that i started this blog and can look back and see how far i have come .
then everyone would know . that i 'm pretending these days . that i 'm anything but okay after i lock my apartment door . that i keep half expecting to suddenly see him when i turn around . that i barely sleep these days because my mind , heart and body clearly want to be awake and elsewhere . the moments i chose to carefully treasure in my mind , frame by frame . him . me . us . lustrous beads of sweat .
i was playing in front of my building when one of my friends told me about a good pickup game at the local schools court , we decided to check it out and we saw that all of the baskets were already taken . luckily another one of my b ball friends was at one of the baskets so we joined him , after a while some girls came up and said they were practicing for a tournament and wanted to play on with us .
oh and on a last note , i really hope that i have nt offended others by what i said and if it seems like i m belittling your feelings , this is not my intention and i m sorry . i do nt know all your stories or pain , but i m sure there is a lot of it . i do not claim to be an expert on anything but my own experiences and i would like to hear yours as well .
as far as operation do nt think about paul , i m getting better at not thinking about him and controlling my emotions . i still try to find excuses to hang out with him though . i know it sounds stupid especially after he was flirting with my friend in plain sight a few days ago , but he also brought up a few things to my attention that i was nt aware of and i m not quite really sure what they mean .
now one more step , in order for both sides of the circle to look finished i did one row of sc , ch , sc around the starting edge where you started with ch . you do n't have to , but it looks a touch more finished . attach your yarn and ch counts as a first sc , sc in the space between two dc in previous row , ch repeat from , join with a sl st in the top of ch
states . songs . different artists i think . i tried to vary the genres as much as possible , and , despite a little complaining , i actually liked the search . also , i found some new stuff that i may listen to again . i hope you guys liked the list as much as i liked putting it together . if you want to catch up on the complete version , then check out parts one , two , three and four .
it is an epic story . truly . but the point is not that my son looks like a hero to his friends . it s really a story about reaching out to others . asking not for yourself but for others , caring about something other than yourself . and it s about a class act bunch of guys on the other side of the united states who saw a good deed done by one of their fans and decided to run with it .
with too many quality moments to capture here , it s safe to say that this film will be somewhere in the record books with box office numbers . for years , few thought that this movie would ever happen . not a fan of post converted d creations so i opted for two and a half hours of d cgi . it looked just fine . believe it the avengers are finally here . this will be a tough act to follow for the sequel .
as i had mentioned a few months ago , may th is our one year blogoversary . several amazing authors and i have come together in this time to host an awesome giveaway to celebrate . from may th to may th we will be hosting a giveaway for the ultimate prize pack . one winner will be picked to win the prize on may th and announced the same day . below you will find some of the authors who are helping to host this event

i 've realized that i feel very much at home there when i go in the bathroom to use the potty yes , i call it that now all the time . having kids , you know . in fact as i go into the bathroom , i have to remember that i 'm not at home and really think about who else is in the house . this is because i almost never shut the door when i use the bathroom in my own house .
a few years later , we were thrilled to learn you were moving to our town , and we were so happy after that , we spent more time together , including one visit on thanksgiving . our screen porch was a closed in room by then , and you were our first thanksgiving guests to eat with us there . i felt so pleased that you had been able to join us . the kids were so excited that night they had a hard time eating
you and your business have a s.w.o.t that should be thoroughly looked into . when you know about these areas in your business then you can figure out what s missing , what s not working right and what is working right . then you can make better plans for improvements towards overall success in your business , projects , career and life . you must know and understand that in business you need more than business planning , you need strategic planning and strategic management .
we may feel protected behind our wall , but we may also feel lonely . walls are built to keep people out . to feel less lonely , we need to make a little crawl space to let people in . we do nt have to destroy our walls in one day , but perhaps we can let at least one person in . we will learn , one person at a time , what it feels like to be less protected , and less lonely .
and there it is . he is absolutely right . when i think about it , it 's pretty amazing that in this life , we have the freedom and opportunity to hit the reset button whenever and wherever we choose . the only person holding me back from where i want to be , is me . self awareness and the ability to admit this to ourselves is the first step in making positive changes in our lives that will inevitably bring us desired results .
say an author has reached that happy place where multiple editors are interested in purchasing her debut novel . would it be viewed as peculiar if the author wanted to interview each editor to find the best fit dollar signs aside not at all . this does n't always happen , but it happens often enough . and the editors involved are usually really pleased when it does it says you value our part in this process as well as the check we 'll cut you .
hello all , yes shock horror a card from me , i ca nt believe it has been weeks since i last made a card wow how life has changed . my beautiful baby girl does not believe is sleeping for more than min at a time , unless she is being held so at the moment my production has dramatically decreased and my spending increased , as i seem to spend a lot of time watching create and craft , and just ca nt resist .
on the mother 's day page , what does your mom always say abby kate well , she 's kind of like , mean . nice . i 'm so proud . what 's sad is , lately , she may be right . she 's been in trouble a little more than usual , so my mean voice has also been out a little too much . it was a good reminder that those little ears are listening to every word ... and every tone .
the best thing a person can do for the world is be themselves , honestly , openly brave and beautiful . by letting your light shine out so that others can feel it gives others the courage to let their light shine too . we are all different , not one of us the same , but we all share a common bond we want to be loved . the only place to start is with the self . love yourself first , share the beauty .
the binding will most likely be fabric binding cut on the straight . i am not sure what fabric i will use yet but i think i will have to buy something specifically for this . i want something very light yet strong so i think silk would be a good option . as for color , i would like a silver blue or robins egg blue or apple green . i 'll have to go to the store and see what their selection is like .
i guess the moral of the story is writers have to believe in their writing . it has to be a part of who we are , in our blood . we have to learn to look at rejections as stepping stones to making our story better . we need to continue to believe in our craft , even when what we get back hurts . we need to find support with fellow creatures of the craft and we have to love ourselves and never give up
however , i know that i am not . i can be reasonably certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that i am on my laptop , that , that evolution is real , that a god does not exist , and much more . i know these things . there are mountains of evidence supporting them and no evidence whatsoever to the contrary . there is no faith involved , nor is there any need for it , because i know it to be true .
i ran into an english friend , matt beer , the other day and asked how his french was coming along . not so good , was the reply . it turns out that matt , one of the funnier people i know , still finds it virtually impossible to be funny in french . because i m also one of the funnier people i know , i totally relate . i asked matt to write a little something about that and here s what he sent .
do you have someone in your life that is always happy smiling all day long and enjoying every bit of life as far as you can tell . how do you feel when you interact with this person do you feel better when you talk to them do they make you want to be happier yourself so what is holding you back you could be that person in the lives of so many by making the simple decision to maintain a positive attitude no matter the situation .
the store will remain open for your orders over the christmas new year period and we will ship out your products as you need them please let me know if things are urgent and we will do our best to get them to you with plenty of time . i am looking forward to a little down time with my family in the coming weeks but i will still be around and popping in and out if i have interesting things to report or photos to show .
on this trip , i even did something similar at the hotel on this trip . a group of coworkers was going to dinner , but i declined the invitation so that i could work out and practice my presentation for the next day . i generally do nt enjoy eating on my own on trips , and i would have joined the crowd if we stayed another night , but , i did possibly end up missing an opportunity to connect and make a new friend .
for the second doll , i realized there were a lot of stories coming in with your entries . each one touched my heart and i wish i could give a doll to every one who wants one , especially those kids who do n't get to see one parent or another as often as one might wish . so i went through the stories , did a little research and chose my second winner not randomly but on a she so needs a daddy doll reaction .
as much as friends like to joke that i 'm a tiger mom , i come up with numerous ways to defend myself saying that i 'm not . case in point i 've never forced son to read . daughter started reading at age , but i never forced her to either . she just loved words and letters and basically figured it out after watching a few of those leapfrog videos . i 'm not kidding i did not force her nor did i push her
writing about a slice of my life was not at the top of my to do list this evening . perhaps , it 's because i 've had a long day . my daughter and i had dentists appointments after work , and i 'm finally home and settling in for the night . now , what to write writing . letters . when was the last time i wrote not on the computer a letter it 's been so long that i ca n't even remember .
the mitm i have been under serious stress because of his business or rather where it 's located . those of you who know me know that i 'm usually the one who laughs off stress or at least , rolls with it , but never lets it show . this time i ca n't pretend or put on the good face . i 'm tired , he 's tired , we tired and it shows . i just need a few days to get it together .
this is nt just about business it s about a way of life . listening to people shows them that you not only value their opinion , but you value them as a person . i find i struggle with this myself thinking about my response to their comment when i should be listening to what they have to say . we must make listening a part of our life s calling . it s essential to our spiritual lives as well . consider the words in james
we must do what feels right in each moment without worry about what others will think about you . and we must not judge others for living their lives differently than ours . did you hear that this is important . again . . . judgment and spiritual arrogance has no place in these times . there are reasons why we are living the way we are living . the way we live our life now might be very different than from a couple of years ago .
we 've all got ordinary , everyday items in our homes that would benefit from some love and attention , right so , this is the challenge , take an ordinary item , does n't matter whether it 's been bought especially to alter or if you 've got something sitting on a shelf that you 've had your eye on just waiting for the right moment . using your craft products , transform it into a piece of art , let your imagination run wild alter it
we added the watermelon pink ribbon to the top of the frame to tie that color throughout the room . we only used the pink as an accent in the room . we then painted the letters white with left over paint from her dresser . the letters were glued on to the glass of the frame , the frames were n't deep enough to put the letters inside . to add another detail to the letters we then added a symbol to go with each letter .
you re probably wondering how jordan became my first kiss after all of this unnecessary drama that i brought upon myself . well , it all started at the end of jordan s senior year . it was may and graduation was right around the corner . i saw him in the hallway at school . instead of running off into another direction and hiding , like i was accustomed to doing whenever i saw jordan , i decided to be a grown up and say hello .
but i do love the snow i do n't drive in it , so i have no reason to not like it . i just look out the window and see how pretty it is in my subdivision . it 's all going to melt away over the next few days though because it 's going to be warm you know , like degrees instead of like it 's been the past couple of weeks . i guess we 'll take what we can get during the winter
with this and other things , this country , and likely others too , are n't going according to god 's will . there are a lot of things now considered acceptable which should n't be . as i said before about being among typical teenagers , they 're doing things like getting drunk purposefully , or getting in trouble with the police . do they care no , does n't seem like it . added to that all that horrible language i hate it if i 'm honest
even if you are not a christian or you do nt have another religion holding you up and i m saying this because god has and does keep me up , that life is too short to live it in bitterness , sometimes you just need to see the good things in life and decide to be happy . this does nt mean that you ca nt ever be sad , but give it a place . we as individuals can choose our own attitudes at any time .
how different the world looked to me . the sunshine seemed brighter , my heart was beginning to realized there was no death sentence . the lord is taking care of me . it made me want to hug my family , kiss my husband and children , and to take more time to be with those around me , to love them in whatever way i can . to laugh more , to ask people more questions , to tell more people about the love of christ .
i think it takes having lived a full life to finally figure what really does matter . when we are children , what really matters is growing up , being an adult we want to be older when we are in high school , we want to get into a good college , then get a good job good luck . then there is career , family , children of our own and our aspirations for them . the answer to the question what really matters keeps changing .
as the old childhood song goes , jesus loves me , this i know , for the bible tells me so and he proves it over and over again . even reminding us as we hear the birds sing in the darkness before the sun rises . in this life there will be times when we may not see or feel the sun son in our situations , but be encouraged , just as sure as the light of dawn is there , so is he so sing on
i am writing this post to let you know how much i hate how you let him slip away . you just do nt know how much it pisses me off every day that you were too afraid to tell him you wish that he would stay . you make me sick with all the things that you never said . if anyone knows how to get the best of me , it s you . you re my best friend and your mind was dead to me .
ok , back to my rant , so maybe you 're busy ... maybe the street as a gallery gets in the way and the objects just do n't speak to you . fine . but , you know , every now and then re consider the idea that maybe you will come across something that you will like by way of street art . every once in awhile , allow yourself to see and hear the intervention . it 's meant , after all , for you .
zombie tag is about decisions . it is about right ones , wrong ones , and dealing with the ones you have made . for that reason i believe anyone can benefit from reading this story . you ca n't go wrong here . the characters are so true to what children are and what they believe . though zombie tag deals with many big issues some parents try to hide from their kids , i believe the story deals with them in a way children can understand .
i think this was a good stage to go through . i had been hurt , and i did need to self protect . and . now i know that my parents did their absolute best for me . knowing what i do of their circumstances and antecedents , i think they did wonderfully well . i love my father s enthusiasm for his work as a teacher , always seeking out new ways to engage with each child . now he is retired , , still dancing .
once we got the all clear that there was no infection her iv came out and we got to go home the next day . driving out of the hospital parking lot with julia in her car seat and brian driving the car i started to cry . i was so happy . i never thought the day would come when we would be able to take a baby home with us . brian cried too . it was one of those moments that i will never forget .
of all the people you have met and ever will , you and me will always stay together . i love what you like and everything you have ever read , i have as well and i can give you a few tips now on what not to read but i think you will ignore me and read them anyways because you never went easily with another person s opinion . yes , i know your motto believe half of what you see and none of what you hear .
so with all that time , i should be doing so much , right the words should be pouring out . i 'm back at work now , part time , so that fills some of my week . but there is still plenty of time for words . oh , i 've written some , ok quite a lot recently , but they 've stopped . gone right off . i need to get back into some sort of routine now , find a work life writing balance .
in a face to face meeting we get the chance to read the body language of our colleagues and clients their body , tone of voice and facial expressions often communicate so much more than just words . studies show that only a small percent of our communication involves actual words . in fact , of our communication is visual body language and facial expressions and is vocal pitch , speed , volume , and tone of voice . therefore the face to face interaction is much more effective .
now i am not throwing my hat in to the ring here for the whole god versus science debate . that would be an endless blog . i am just touching on things that i personally view that god has taken away from me making me the way he did , and now the things that technology is given back to me . the whole spiritual versus science debate is something that goes way over my head , and i can see parts of both sides of that argument .
you know how when you have something tough coming up that you have to deal with you think about it all week , you just want the day to be over with the day that holds the bad event . and then the day comes , goes and you live through it and go on with your life . that is my day every day . that day will finally be done with when bear is . till then i just constantly have this twisting feeling in my gut .
the climax of the episode was really well done . the action moves pretty quickly from one revelation to another , from one reaction to another , and all that shit that went down in the first place is on pace to being resolved . however , there are a few loose threads that were introduced when the new details were added that i ca nt really explain without pulling something out of my ass , so i ll leave it to future episodes to explain it for me .
think about it this way . you have a boy who loves art . you do nt love art . you have no talent for art as far as you re concerned . being the best dad you can be , you learn to love art , you learn to be better at art . being the best dad you can be for your kid , you encourage him to be the artist . you pursue what is best for them , not what you wish they would do .
my previous phone was a flip phone that had served me well for many years but did not text or take photos . i did n't really need those features . at least i thought i did n't . the main reasons for wanting a new phone was the limited volume and short ring before going to voice mail . i do n't text often , but i do occasionally find this a nice feature and the camera is so handy that now i would be lost without it .
multitasking is a big part of modern life that everyone has experience with . for a time , multitasking was a buzz word that suggested you were getting a great deal done in an efficient way . more recently , however , many time management experts have become rather critical of multitasking , stating it makes you less rather than more efficient . multitasking actually can make you more efficient , but not at all times so let s see when it is and is nt a fantastic idea .
i asked the local school if i could come in and be a ' fly on the wall ' to gather some ideas , she writes in the introduction . but she soon found how difficult it is to be invisible in the classroom . one boy called john was especially curious . john asked me why i was sitting in the corner making notes . i told him that i was trying to get ideas for some poems . he suggested that the first poem be about him .
alright , so ... writing this review is going to be hard . i knew it would be , because writing reviews for books you love is extremely difficult . writing reviews for books you adore is damn near impossible . i can not imagine covering in words all the things i want to say or all the things this book made me feel . it just was everything i hoped it was going to be , everything i thought it was going to be , and then some .
although happy to read stories and snuggle in his bed , he does nt actually want to sleep in it by himself . i have rarely been successful leaving the room before he is asleep . if he does fall asleep he does it with at least one hand holding on to my arm , which makes it very hard to get out of bed without him waking up . we tend to do better on the weekends when he is more tired because he does nt get a nap .
if you choose to call today the first of april and then go about your business as if it were the first of april , you will meet very little trouble doing that , apart from a few problems with others trying to correct you and pointing out that it is in fact the second day of april . the simple point here is , until we create the impression that time has a label , there is really no difference between the past , the present and the future .
the thing is , we all stop walking with him from time to time . you know when you re having one of those horrible days , nothing seems to go right , everyone is out to get you and you ca nt breathe from all the pressure coming at you from every direction did you forget to walk with jesus that day did you give him those troubles that were weighing you down or were you trying to do it all on your own like we so often do .
this week i would like to share some of the healthy but looks real yummy snack and meal ideas i have found . i have been eating rather poorly for quite a while now okay , okay , my eating habits suck and i need to change them . one of the problems is , all the recipes i see and end up pinning look really good but are not good for me . so i recently found some recipes i would like to try and thought i would share .
the halloween weekend was n't quite as busy as everyone thought it would be . it was still busy , but not as busy as is it had fallen on a friday or saturday . i saw some pretty good costumes and took a few pictures , but once we started getting busy i really did n't have time to snap any pics . it seemed as though there were quite a few house parties compared to previous years . all in all it was a a pretty good weekend .
i will do my best to set up a tour package . those of you who offer to let me drop by on my hop , i 'm hoping to hook you up with a copy of the book . it will be an e book , of course . print may come later , i 'm still not sure about that . i 'd also like to have a little banner or something . i 'm sort of waiting to see what my cover will look like first . woot
the race started . and for me it ended around minutes later . i had promised a girl friend of mine from the track that i would run with the other guys in our group . and so i did . at least until the last km or so . another moment of the group is more important the individual . at the end they released me with much heckling . we 'll see if they 're mad a me or not when it comes to hit the track tuesday .
these were a huge hit with henry which was great because i always buy the happy baby yogurt melts from target , but they run about a pop . and really , he goes through them way too quickly to justify spending that much on one bag of snacks i got an entire cookie sheet full of drops from just one small yogurt container , and i 'd much rather have him enjoy straight yogurt than freeze dried ones in a package . and like i said , henry loved them
luckily , i have a strong support group of friends and family who were there for me through every step of my recovery , even through a semester i took off from school . i also had a great therapist who spent months working with me , teaching me that i do have control over my own life and that things do nt have to be so bad . thanks to her , i was able to return to jmu after a semester off ready to take on the world .
you could create a special scrapbook page for your mom and frame it or add it to an album to give as a gift and add more pages to over time . you do n't need to do the traditional x album you can make it any size and style . i love the colors and patterns victoria used on this digital layout using cd , creating with vintage patterns and she can print it in any size to create a mini scrapbook page or a card for her mom .
i guess i take after my dad , who s still learning new stuff at the age of using his computer , figuring out facebook spent hours with him on that today , learning more about the bible and god and his ways dad got saved in october , at the age of he s never been afraid to learn something new and he s always pushed me to do the same . i m told that mental challenges keep our brains healthy . that s a good thing , right
a mother has far greater influence on her children than anyone else , and she must realize that every word she speaks , every act , every response , her attitude , even her appearance and manner of dress affect the lives of her children and the whole family . it is while the child is in the home that he gains from his mother the attitudes , hopes , and beliefs that will determine the kind of life he will live and the contribution he will make to society .
i had told him earlier in the evening about my troubles with monty the accident , my bone deep fears , the grandmother buying him a car , monty moving in with his father . as we drove back to town that morning , a news story about a teen getting killed in a car accident that night caught my ear . as i reached over to turn it up he said , it happened in the western part of the island . he knew without me saying a word .
the doctor just came in and told us that she does need to have surgery to correct this , and it needs to happen before next week , or we could be looking at a very severe situation . problem is , there 's nobody at this hospital that can do it laparoscopically , so they 'll have to transfer her down to a hospital in downtown kansas city tomorrow . i 'm thinking i 'll probably delay my flight home and come back to austin afterwards , if i can .
i love the process as when i worked on coming up with my life statement last year , even though there was a process i worked through , it took a long time as there was n't any real impetus to completing it other than that we 'd been asked to do it . having a task to complete by a specific date is so much better as it means you commit to doing something , even if only with yourself , and can focus on what you need to do .
which may be true , or might not be true . if it 's not , then because of that awesome critique , i now know what the issue is . and if i have an issue in one work , it 's probable that i have a similar issue in another work . and i need to figure out what the fix is , or if i need to do some craft related research , so i can learn how to fix it . but it 's mine to fix .
i ve got a fairly standard routine . after i ve dropped the kids at school i write almost straight through until i pick them up . i aim to get , words down per day . i also work in a cafe a few days a week , just for a change of scene and i enjoy seeing people . i ve written two books in that cafe so the locals know me well . writing can be a very lonely profession so it s good to work in company .
think about your relationships . have you struggled with how to make some of them deeper maybe it is nt about spending more time with one another or helping out with chores or sharing more interests . maybe it is about being willing to expose your authentic self . the deep , dark corners and the wonderful bright spots . the fears and the dreams . and when that feels scary , try taking taking a deep breathe and dive in . i bet you ll have enough air to breathe .
so why did my heart start pounding at the thought of these people holding up a few signs a million thoughts began racing through my mind . max ca n't read yet , and is n't likely to notice them , and any questions could easily be dismissed and forgotten in his three year old mind . the campus entrance is a good distance from his classroom , so it 's highly unlikely they 'd be anywhere near him . i know security is tight and his teachers are well trained .
what i do this is one of my favorite lines i use , and always spoken with a hard southern bill clinton accent , when i ask folks why they are pissed about something i said . i am the type of guy who will ask a question , in response to comments people make . i will respond to comments i here in the grocery line , at work , in a tavern , or at a family christmas party . nobody gets a free pass on publicly made comments .
the reason i m telling you this is because i met a guy the other day and was perfectly happy to have a chat to him , but did nt really want to take it any further . then he asked me for my number . ugh . i had spoken to him for about minutes , he said he had to go but we should catch up sometime . so i gave him my number , as it was easier than arguing with him . he text me last night saying
me i would describe myself with the word unique and understanding . i try to understand people . sometimes i succeed , other times not . i seem to keep finding myself in the same situation . i know this guy who seems to like me . but there s a catch , he has a girlfriend . he spends time with me but claims to love her . it confuses me and sometimes i wonder why i am even still doing it . so many questions , so few answers .
when you try your best but you do nt succeed , when you get what you want but not what you need when you feel so tired but you ca nt sleep stuck in reverse . when you love someone but it goes to waste , could it be worse when you re too in love to let it go but if you never try you ll never know just what you re worth . lights will guide you home and ignite your bones and i will try to fix you .
this one 's gon na be a short one because i 'm tired , i 've had some wine , and i 've got to do some reading before i go to bed which will happen shortly , i hope . however , a techno dance party with some really loud and very bass heavy music started about minutes ago in the student union that 's only a tennis ball 's throw away from my open windows . and i 'm a girl , so i do n't throw very far .
it s also a great place to talk about a business you might have and would like to promote . if it is strictly for business then write some content that adds value , do nt just write buy my stuff articles but give some tips on how your product or service adds value to peoples lives . for instance , if you are a photographer , you might write articles on how to take a good photograph or what time of day is good for a certian type of shot .
i do not know the name of the film , but i have seen it in a collection of shorts called wholphin . i 'd watch these with my mother because we 're both into odd and short . this is a part of one of those films . it does n't start with the beginning , so i 'm not sure what we 've missed , but with these kind of things , you can pretty much pick up at any point and have the same level of understanding confusion .
as i sit here and type this another mother is having to prepare to say goodbye to her precious child . this child is fighting to stay alive to live with his parents for another moment . sadly , this child was given a short life expectancy . born only three days ago , this child may soon have to return home to the lord . it breaks my heart to know that this family will suffer another loss of a child . yes , another as they already lost one .
have you ever found yourself scouring antique stores , garage sales , and your jewelry box for metal appearing , vintage like embellishments for your crafting projects i have countless times . i have also come up completely empty handed on many of these occasions as well , not having found that perfect accent piece . today i am going to show you how to make faux metal embellishments that you can alter , ink , and distress , to make exactly what you would like to see on your project .
the last of my su retired sets that i am selling at this time . these stamps are all . or less and most are in excellent used condition and many of the sets have one or two stamps mounted and the others are ready to by mounted . it 's a bad habit , but i often only mount what i 'm going to use . this will be your last chance to buy these sets from me . i am donating what i do n't sell on december th .
at the moments when i had to move forward and literally take things moment by moment , i could handle things . i did n't have room for the emotions because i was focused on the crisis . as i was sitting in my pool of emotions , i realized that i was n't in a crisis situation , but it had become normal for me to be in crisis , and without an actual crisis to hold my focus , i was vulnerable to seeing the reality of the situation .
there are times when i wake up thinking . i hate starting my day that way . i woke up thinking about share your success day . share your success day is this thursday and is basically parent open house . parents come in to school and their children guide them through the classroom showing off all the wonderful things they have done throughout the year . i 've collected writing samples and art work , we 've planted seeds , watched caterpillars change into butterflies and learned some songs and poems .
well now the funk is over and i am feeling very overwhelmed . i have so much i want to say and i am kind of not sure where to begin . this is such a busy and fun time of year for us . spring brings baseball and good weather and reasons to spend it outdoors and both the kids birthdays and looking ahead to summer and seeing what it is going to have in store for us . so much going on and coming up in the next few months .
what happens when you engage in a conversation with someone in the car or on the telephone even when using a hands free device most of the time your brain is working over time to think of what you are going to say next or to listen to what they are saying . how many times have you missed your exit or missed your turn because you were engaged in a conversation worse yet , have you ever had the other person say to you , are n't you supposed to turn here
heavenly father , he prayed . thank you for this promise of a new day . we praise you that you have protected us when our enemies have threatened , and that you continue to provide . we thank you for the land you have blessed us with , and ask only that , if it is your will , you would continue to protect our homes in the future . thank you for the food that we are about to eat , and for the hands that made it . amen .
i have n't been able to get on my grass for a fortnight so it is getting long , but it looks great and green and it 'll stay dry long enough for it to get cut before long i 'm sure . i saw a farmer on the local tv news who was talking about the devastating effect of no rain and having driven past a few fields lately , the new crops are looking good , in fact the yellow rape seed oil plants are in full flower in places .
in january , i ran the k . as i crossed the finish line , i made two phone calls . the first was to my husband to say i had done it . the second was to my trainer to thank him . he had believed in me and he showed me how to believe in myself . the next day , as i watched thousands of people complete the half marathon , i told the race directors , i d be back next year and i would run the half .
here are some ideas for you to consider if you are having problems . remember that your mortgage payment is by far the most important payment to keep current . why , if you get behind with a mortgage payment of . usually there is not likely that you will have . next month to get it current . with that said , with my experience it would be more profitable for you to think about the other things you are paying that you might could do without to pay your mortgage .
but the move should be over by wednesday . good news , right eh , not really , i ll probably be heading out of state to help my sister with her kids while she s in the hospital recovering from giving birth to her fourth . i ll be out there a month at the most , as she has had a very difficult pregnancy . and i love her kids . i ll probably hate them by the time i get back home , but right now i love them .
as soon as we had a name for it , i wrote to c 's teachers . i explained the problems he was having in class we 'd already had his section meeting that year so there were no accommodations in place for this and asked that they let him change seats , wear his ear buds , whatever worked for them and him in the classroom . they were all very understanding , though unfortunately nothing we tried really worked and he had a very stressful spring semester as a result .
this was a parent saying this about his son who just finished high school and wants to do something else before spending another to years in an institution . he meant he might discover a passion something that he might really get into and love and enjoy and that will consume his life because it thrills him so much . he might even make a living out of it . he might even help others through this interest . but no . oh no . he wo n't be ' educated . '
your makeup is as important to your finished look as the clothing you wear , in fact , it can actually be more important . we 've all spotted women who did n't have a clue how to apply their eye shadow . but we 've also saw women who know how to apply it properly and they look put together and beautiful . do n't you want to be one of those women of course and we are going to give you some top tips so you can do just that .
but really when i sit back and think ..... you know if you just relax , it will all be okay . i know i let more of god 's will in , and i do n't have to make these bigger decisions alone . i know everything i have ever forced , did not work out . i have learned a lot the hard way and also sometimes the more painful way . and i know i can handle whatever is thrown my way with the support of god and my husband .
observation i guess i am noticing this morning that jesus is saying that he will give us all that we ask the father in his name , but only in such a way that it will make our joy complete . if we are asking for something that would not complete our joy , then it will not be given to us . we must , therefore , be humble in asking for what we need , because we do not know if giving it to us would indeed make our joy complete .
program writing has definitely come a long way since i was young , along with the ever expanding choice of channels , and the shows themselves are a lot more educational than i ever remember . this is a good thing , and i m pleased my kids can actually learn something from them . however , after being at home for nearly four year and in that time , having been exposed to pretty much every kids show in existence , there are a few things that irritate the heck out of me
now in this passage it appears that peter said here that the lord jesus christ has two above him . one is god and the other is the father . so now there is here . god and . the father and . the lord jesus christ . however god in this passage is one and the father is one . jesus is one . so far it is three . however the first two are the same or are they who is god the first person or is the first person the father
have you ever thought about becoming a real estate paralegal and not only a real estate paralegal , but a commercial real estate paralegal good for you i found that a real estate deal has a life unto itself and coming to the closing is in some ways similar to approaching the finish line of a corporate challenge marathon . you prepared and practiced for many days you ran and came to the finishing line . the only difference is that after the award ceremony , there is more work to be done .
however , you probably do not need research to tell you that giving makes you feel good just think back to the last time you helped a colleague who was stuck with a problem , worked on a team , part of a volunteer committee , community association or took your assistant out to lunch . giving boosts our energy in a way that nothing else can . we feel connected and engaged when we help others , because it reminds us of what it means to be human , at its best .
what 's interesting is that now that i 'm back on the west coast , closer to my family and old friends , i do n't feel as though i 'm actually any closer . i certainly see my old friends more , but i do n't see my friends back in ny at all . and i have only seen my family a couple of times in the few months since i 've been back , which really is n't all that much different from when i lived on the other coast .
the email looks authentic and i bet it 'll fool a lot of people . one giveaway though is the date . supposedly i made the purchase on may nd , which would make sense if i lived in korea , where it 'd been may nd for a while . but here in the states it was only am and i was pretty sure i 'd not ordered anything between midnight and am . they should have at least dated the fake purchase date as may st to make it more plausible .
i d planned to stop writing about grief . someone i respect said , there comes a time when it s healthy for one to move on and drop the grief banner . it comes at different times for different people and it is an important part of the healing process . i thought i was at that point . i ve been getting on with my life , living each day as it comes , dealing with the loneliness , seeing the whole of our shared life rather than the terrible end .
i 'm so tempted to call her and tell her to get the hell out of our lives . she has never done any of us any good by being in it . i know that 's harsh , but it 's true . i 've been hurt by her before , but that pain has been replaced with anger . and i will protect my dad and my family in any way i feel the need too . and if that means giving her a call , i 'll do just that .
back on it . back on the ordinary let s see what i m thinking today sort of entry , the sort of thing i have nt been writing while i work through the synopsis of dead not dreaming or whatever it s going to be called . never did have a good idea for the title . still do nt . that s okay , sometimes things like that do nt come along until you re very nearly done she said , from the great depth of her experience with such matters .
what kind of trick do you choose or you should choose any at all , it is up to you . there is only one book on the world , which contains your recipe for changing ... this is the one you have written my truth wo n't be true for you , but you can use elements , ideas which fit to you . i hope mine will help you at least with giving tips to you , but you must add your own tips to your system to make personal for yourself
when i remember back on things that make me feel guilty i tend to remember them as if i m looking at myself from outside my body . it 's a false sense of memory , perhaps a way to deal with the guilt . there are many things i do nt remember at all . my brother is good at telling me things i said years ago that i ca n't remember in any shape or form . maybe i do n't remember those because they did nt make me feel guilty .
the only thing i want is you . the other thing i want is honesty please always be honest with me even when you think it s going to hurt me or it s going to be uncomfortable for you to tell me i promise you that if you do that , i will respect you and love you more than i already do because i already accept everything about you nothing you tell me is going to make me leave if you do nt want me to go . sam to the mic .
i did nt end up getting back until am , to discover .. my roommate still awake . what the actual hell how late do i have to stay out in order for her to be in bed before i am every single time i stay out she still is up later than i am , by at least half an hour . i do nt understand . anyway , since she was up , i was as loud as i wanted and even took the time to call my mom and talk loudly .
i was very disappointed that i could n't take part in the walk of witness this year . it would have been too far for me to walk a good half hour to get there then all the way back . if the service had been just at one church i might have gone to that but it was n't it started at the assembly point and was continued at two other churches . still i am glad i spent all day at church yesterday and took part in the read through the bible .
next , i told emily that she could make letters too . she wanted to try an e for the first letter of her name . then she wiped it away i had her to try another letter . we took turns picking letters , writing them and then making the sound . since the letters in the paint are so easy to wipe away if she made a mistake she could easily try again . as emily got older she now likes to try to write the different words that she knows too .
days ago daisy was searching for the key of the other drawer and while i was on my place she opened my drawer and start looking for it inside . i got mad , closed my drawer , gave her an evil look and asked what s wrong with you . i ca nt stand people touching my stuff . she said what are you hidding . i did nt even bother to reply . i do nt hide anything but still , that drawer is a bit messy but it is my drawer .
you know what the best side effect of running for your health is it inspires me to eat better . why would i mess up a good workout with junk until i started focusing on exercise for health , i never could commit to eating healthy all the time . i worked out so i could eat crap and still be thin , which definitely did n't work . i 'm happy i 've made my way to this spot . it took years to get here , and i will never turn back .
with this outfit , i got her to spin round , walk forward etc to create this theme of freedom , to come through my photographs . i think it worked really well on most of them . however the ones where she is still , the background looks quite boring , making her stand out and look free to do as she likes . i got her to stand next to a tree in one of them , and took it slightly lower than eye height , to show how tall she is .
the reality is despite the fact that she s one of the kindest people i know , understanding , smart and loves her friends and family with all her heart . she is a woman , and all that does nt matter as much whenever she takes a look at herself in the mirror . her amazing feathers and her feelings may not match up just yet . at this point all i can do is tell her what i see and wait for the moment or day she sees it like i do .
it was only a dream but everything felt so real . if that was god and anna s way of telling me that she is in a better place right now , then i will do my share of letting go . i will try my best to let go of a best friend , who was and will continue to become a part of my life . you maybe gone , but your memories will remain with me forever anna . you will always be the one and special anna in my heart .
last week was prettymuch a success . i did indeed visit the local catholic church and found the people there are so sweet and welcoming . i doubt i 'll get matt into the church anytime soon , but considering our relationship was founded partially on the basis of leaving each other 's religious beliefs alone , i wo n't blame him for it . there will come a time , however , when fellowship will cause me to tap into weekend family time . i 'll deal with that when i come to it .
am i silly to feel this way or is it normal i know i will enjoy it when i get there and yes not having to run the girls around and walk the dog and cook the meals and tidy up and so on will be very relaxing . the fact still remains that our little family just does n't work right apart this is fueling a desire to really make changes in our life more on that in the future . i want radical change but we all need to agree on that one .
and it certainly speaks miles about god , that he would want to choose the jews as his people . history have shown again and again that we have failed . even today we find it hard to show our gratitude to finally having a country of our own as well as others also , we should nt forget that , but yet he stayed loyal through it all , even when we in general did not . sure , he punishes , but more than that does he forgive , care , and love .
cousins is a truly powerful writer , managing to have me laughing out loud during one scene and crying during the next i loved how the atmosphere in the story changed so quickly from happy to tragic , exactly how it does in real life . i think that 's the main strength of this book , that it is so incredibly real . it stays realistic from beginning to end and i 'm really pleased that the ending is realistic , rather than the hollywood ending i know some writers would have gone for .
a year and a half has passed since then and it just could n't leave me alone , could it i deliberately laid off the song because i felt sorry for it . it seemed to be trying to do something that it was n't capable of . it was trying to be the new all the way down but could n't muster the proper emotion and epic ending to pull it off so i decided , out of the kindness of my heart not to rip on it . that all went to shit .
once you have a basic idea of what you want and how much you want to pay for it , then this is a good time to go to your local dealership . any questions that you were not able to answer , the dealership should be able to answer them . take a test drive of the car you want and make sure it s comforting to you . you do nt want to drive a car that makes you feel awkward , especially since you ll have this product for quite a while .
i told myself that tina and i were just friends . i had a girlfriend two years younger than me back home . she was my first serious girlfriend , and we had that kind of crazy , intense relationship you have when you are trying to make things work long distance , and you both talk about how you 'll probably break up eventually , because you 're sensible , but you 've also gone ahead and named your future kids , just in case . tina referred to her as my child bride .
when the boy woke up he was really hot . i never take a temperature on a kid unless it lasts more than a day , or they are so hot they ca nt move . i just give them something for it . so now , i am in the house with a hot kid and a smelly dog . i really am starting to wonder if having the perfect bunny is going to make up for this . i m a mess . i ca nt even decide what i want for dinner .
when the police finally left we learned that a couple in the apartment across the street were having an argument and the guy pulled out a gun . nice , huh nice to know our neighbors are packing heat . ugh . i hate to even think about it , really . still , no shots were fired and we did really enjoy our time together . we kept the family vibe going that night . jerry and i did our sidewalk art partially inspired by the police encounter , as you might guess . .
i 've been learning and growing in my time management skills as i 've had to figure out how to balance being a wife , mother , apartment manager and friend this year . it has proven to be good , hard work as i learn the importance of putting the needs of my husband and kids before work and household chores . i never realized how hard it would be to put the laundry down or leave a sink full of dirty dishes so that i could play and spend quality time with my boys
i think what struck us the most was the students enthusiasm and confidence when discussing their research and process and how using dh they were able to go beyond traditional scholarship . for most of the students , this was their first time using dh tools and methods . it was also great just to see examples of dh work in action . as eric pointed out , examples like these make the concept of dh more concrete and demonstrate a need for infrastructure andor centers to support students and faculty working on digital projects .
after listening to this song and a few others i felt so filled and blessed to spend time focusing on god and who he is , and where he opens my eyes to his beauty . it 's all around and yet so many times my eyes and heart are not open to see it . i prayed that the lord would continue to open my eyes to see him . he sees every detail of me and yet i want to see more of him , and know more of his character and beauty .
and that s another hint , the format that works for you . you can find a million different synopsis examples online or through your writer s groups . just like writing your book , you have to create a synopsis in your own voice and in a style that you re comfortable with . there is no right or wrong to this . three pages , five pages , ten pages , it does nt matter as long as you are including the important information who , what , why , where , and how .
still settling in and seeing how things work . getting to know people very slowly because of the language barrier . it s pretty difficult . the care workers that come and visit us in the apartment every day are telling people to not speak to me in english they say that i should learn the language of the country , which i agree with , but still , it s tough . my level is pretty basic so when it comes to trying to have a conversation with someone , we do nt get very far
so wake up it is a brand new day , do nt just lay there . get up and give my god some praise , for he is worthy each and everyday . get up and began to pray . for you not know what the day will bring your way . but if you followed my recipe for joy above , my god will take good care of you with a whole lot of love and a little bit of grace . it is then you will be ready to run the race of today .
i then start wonder about the children who commit suicide . is it always depression or a psychological disorder what causes it or can it sometimes be a fad i understand suicide is something that can be caused by more than just one factor . but is it something that now is so talked about and in news and media , that children almost find it to be an option to their problems . it worries me that a child who originally would have never had the thought of suicide would now consider it an option .
my buddy joe must have figured out something , but i do n't know or at least i do n't remember if he ever said anything . joe gave me the book victims no longer . i did n't want to read it at first but i started and that 's when i understood that he was a pedophile . i knew the word before then , but i did n't know that 's how it was . i thought they only went for kids who were four or five years old . i was sixteen .
good morning everyone . i am getting ready to start day of my long work weekend . for those of you who do n't know , i work , hour shifts in an er per week . so every other weekend , i work days straight and the other days are worked throughout the weeks . i really like this schedule since some weekends are n't an option , but it does limit my time on those weekends i work . i did just want to update you on a few things going on right now .
he is older than me again but it 's an acceptable age difference . he 's . and very fit . he was in the navy up until years ago when he retired , he 's now a health and safety inspector and got a degree in engineering and he 's doing a masters now just for fun because he wants to keep his brain working . he 's got no kids but is open to it , if it happens at some stage in his life it happens , if not that 's fine too .
i would let you know that i 've finally decided to joint the craze and read the hunger games . a friend told me the premise behind the story , and i saw the trailer this week and i knew it would be a story i would love . i 'm off this week to buy a copy of the first book . i hope i can finish it before the movie comes out in march , but first i need to finish the book i 'm halfway through . have you read the hunger games yet
my children help me to be more reasonable . they make me question everything that does not make sense . i am also lucky to have a husband who makes me think . i listen to my children and my husband , and i can redefine what makes a good mother as often as i need to . that does n't mean i always get it right . it does n't mean i always know what 's best or that i am perfect . and it does n't mean i think i 'm better than you .
sell everything as being mutually beneficial which may be the hardest thing you ever do . how think before you open your mouth . ask yourself how can i sell bill on helping to defend sue s plot and how could it be beneficial to him if it does nt appear beneficial look at the list of four items up top and work your way down . if all else comes up blank she s a member of our community and lives in our neck of the woods . that means something to most rural folk .
there are many reasons why israel exists today , why it should , why it must . sometimes , you can give a complicated answer , and sometimes , the answer is so simple . today is a simple one . this morning , a plane flew into israel from russia . it was a special flight , sent to there by the state of israel . on board the plane , as it landed in israel , was a special medical team , and a young man in critical condition . aharon alexander is years old .
this is a skill that would be great for your child to know when entering kindergarten , by the truth is it might be too much to know by september . i would expect most children to know by january though . start with the first letter of your child 's first name . whenever you see his her name in print , point out the first letter and say its name . pick random letters as you encounter them on a cereal box or license plate , in a book , on a toy be creative .
taking an example from the world of business . henry ford first built an assembly line to produce cars . this was a revolutionary concept at the time . yet , people now could not imagine putting things together without an assembly line . it is so much more effective in terms of staff , resources , and work flow . to me , best practices are something we all do such as story times , and they determine what the best , most cost effective , and patron friendly way of doing this program or service .
i am so thankful for my family . i am so blessed to have a family like i do one that is so fun to be around and so caring and thoughtful . i miss them when i am gone and soak up all the time i can get with them my husband is the best ever and i ca n't imagine living my life without him he is the one who knows me best and the one i can always talk to about anything and i 'm so blessed to feel so comfortable with him about everything
step two is giving something of value . this is beyond just the simple ebook to get someone to join your list . this is actually starting to build a relationship with your list . they will come to know you as a person they can trust and actually like and listen to . this is where the value comes in . then , once they like and trust you , you can send them a product or service that they will really spend some time checking out and they will buy making you a commission essentially .
art is a powerful and valid form of expression , as is music and any other kind of talent . however it does not define me as a person . i am not the sum result of my work . i am the sum result of the people around me , the god i serve and what he says about me , and each day as it comes . how i treated the people in my life , how quick i am to forgive and to give and to extend grace . those are my daily challenges .
i have spoken before about just how important it is to believe in yourself and that you have to make a conscious decision that you are going to succeed at what you set out to do . in fact every successful person i have spoken to chose to be successful at what they do . they knew what they wanted and they went for it . but i realize that is easier said than done , otherwise we would all be experiencing high levels of success and there would be no need for a a course like mine
at we made our way to the corral . i was supposed to start in , but since it was steven s first race , i joined him in . he and i had nt run together since last summer at the beach , but i knew it would be a good time to at least run the first few miles together . we started around minutes after the first corral was sent off . that was perfectly acceptable to me since i knew that we would take our time and put down around a min mile pace .
to be clear , no one taught me this . no one sat me down and said , boy , doing this stuff is what it means to follow jesus . just the opposite actually . i was told all the time about salvation being an undeserved gift of grace and all about faith . but what i was told and what we practiced was completely different . for example , we said we were saved by faith , but if you missed two sunday s in a row people started to wonder if you were still saved .
i , for one , am looking forward to see the team put together a full three set domination that has been somewhat lacking so far in the tournament compared to the regular season this team had . the scary thing is , for the rest of the teams in the tournament at least , that this team absolutely has not quite played its best so far . if it was able to put together a complete effort for three more matches , there is not a team in the country that will be able to stop them .
my other blog help i need a publisher takes up a lot of time . maybe an hour a day , often more . i blog on it at least three times a week , and reply to all comments most posts get around comments , sometimes as many as ish . yesterday 's got well over a hundred people also email me off blog including agents , editors and publishing industry people . that sounds like a lot of work for no money and it is a lot of work but here 's what i get from it
i am thinking that maybe i am one sick puppy . i am pretty convinced that most people think i am a mean person . normal people do nt think the way i do , and normal people usually do nt give voice to the thoughts in their heads like i do . of course , normal people do nt live my life . and normal people do nt deal with jimmy . but i do , i did , and i am . so there you go . here s what is new on this whole jimmy saga
i knew i wanted to take a picture of it . i figured i would have to wait till it had risen high enough in the sky to clear the trees surrounding my house and neighborhood . i 'm kind of in a low spot . last year when the super moon appeared in march , i could see how spectacular it was as it rose just barely peeking through the trees but by the time i could get a clear shot at it , it had lost it 's bright red color and was a bit smaller .
as we prepared to head back to the states and home i reflected on the trip . we saw a lot , we did a lot and we ate an awful lot . everyone thanked me for the trip but i was thankful for the fact that for weeks , all of us were a family . i was thankful that i was able to share a bit of family history and irish heritage with my daughters . i hope now they appreciate what i mean when i call the british , no good so and so s .
i ve spent all day trying to figure out how to put a positive spin on how much yesterday sucked , and i just ca nt do it . so i m not going to try . there s no need . some days are just bad . some days suck . some days you give up on yourself . that was yesterday . i gave up on myself so bad , i walked out of the gym . i was nt into it and did nt want any part of it . so i said screw it .
one thing that stood out to all of us is that each of the students who visited us , all seniors , had really solid plans for life after high school that covered the broad range of options available to young people that included college and much more . this indicated to us that these students have been provided the opportunity and support to explore all of their options and make the best decision for themselves based on their goals and interests . we are curious what do you do to help students prepare for life after the met
the thing that always motivated us about starting a business was knowing that whatever work we put in to it , we were going to directly gain out of it . there is no sitting around and hoping everything falls into place . if you have a passion and are willing to put the work in , go for it . for students , this is a great point in your life to think about starting a business because the time and resources that are available now are exponentially greater than what you will have in the future .
with this in mind , i am going to have to start work on that special project for my mum 's august birthday this week . i will check i have everything i need and then dye the fabric tomorrow all being well . i should therefore be able to start stitching on wednesday . this is not a small project , and i am sure my mum will understand if it 's not quite ready in time for her birthday , but as it 's a big one her th it would be nice if it was .
hello everyone i tried something new today . i made a card using the book feature on the elegant edges cartridge . i think it turned out kind of cool , but since this type of card is harder to open i do n't think i will be making a lot of them . you have to leave your binding material twine , ribbon etc loose enough so you can open the card . i was going to use ribbon but the twine makes it much easier to open . so have a look and tell me what you think
then my special events class is pretty crazy too . we are two weeks away from the event and my teacher is mad that we ran into some problems with the venue so late she wanted us to visit the venue during the first few weeks and people in my group kept saying they were going to and then never did . so we decided to go during class time one day and we ran into some problems . so now we are all stressed that we have extra things to figure out and there are only two weeks left
adults who are so selfish , think they will simply take care of their problem by killing a cheating spouse or one that they have decided they just do nt love anymore somehow , they have justified murder instead of divorce .. thinking , i assume , the problem will die with the person and maybe they will save face somehow .. hard to understand that line of thinking . someone who just a few months . years or even days ago had told us how much they love us would be capable of doing such a horrible thing .
december th i ve noted that i was at the shop . we were closed still for the holidays as we d usually given our employees the week off with pay as a christmas present . i noted at shop pm , found rob at pm year ago amazing how much difference year makes . am not exactly sure what i meant about year making so much difference , but although in some ways it felt like a lifetime ago that rob had died , in other ways , it felt like little to no time had gone by .
the company also sends you a daily sentence through email , and this is where the depressing part comes in . i do nt know who they hired to create the sentences , but some sentences are pretty disturbing and make me think the guy has been going through some sort of break up or something for the past year . i can never see myself using a lot of these sentences i hope , but they provide chris and me with daily entertainment . i thought i would share some of my favorites that germanflashcards.com has sent to me
since the morgan drama that i posted about in the last entry there has been some new developments , namely that there is a good chance she will be getting sold soon and will be leaving the barn . the news took me completely by surprise and i was pretty upset about it at first . i 'm alright about it now , it 's not like i wanted her to stay forever and become a lesson horse , plus she 's going to be a year old girl 's horse so hopefully she will be spoiled and loved .
i think it s fair to say , being a mother is a difficult task . some of us do it well , some , not so well , but we never set out to be bad moms . we all try to do the best we can within the parameters of our circumstances . in other words , there s no owner s manual . i believe that our background and circumstances may have influenced who we are , but we are responsible for who we have become . that holds truth for our kids , as well .
what everyone needs to understand is that the universe is huge and the truth is we know only so little of it . science has been wrong thousands of times before it can be wrong again but so has christianity . it was at one point that all bibles were in latin and only priests could have them but that is no longer the case . all we can do is believe what we want to believe and live life as we see fit . we will find out once we die what is correct or we wo nt .
now , unless i have to get up really early for a specific reason , i never set an alarm my body wakes me up naturally between and am . so imagine my surprise when i woke up and it was am five days of the week that would nt be an issue . unfortunately , today was nt one of those five . no time for shower no time for coffee just wash up and get ready for work . it really made me feel out of sort for the morning but sleeping was better than not sleeping .
i am still doing well . so far this week i am down another two pounds . maybe i can make it pounds by friday . planning my meals has been a huge success for me . i make a grocery list every saturday , my husband does the grocery shopping and then i package and freeze what needs to be frozen when he gets home . it has made my life so much easier . i do n't need to reach for the unhealthy food because i have great tasting low fat food right at my finger tips .
valentine s day is an beautiful holiday . i do nt understand the complaints , because it is a celebration of the greatest gift and most powerful force in the entire world . love comes in all shapes and sizes . sometimes it s obvious , other times more subtle . but what we have to remember above all things is that love is something to be treasured , not feared . society teaches us that love is a strong , dangerous word , and that it should be used only in special circumstances and after very careful consideration why
fact number i never even considered searching the name online . never . who would have known that this very thing might be a good idea . like i said , i really had no idea what a blog was about . i thought you 'd write a post and 's of people would come comment and love you ha that first post only got one comment and i have no idea how they even found me . see , i told you i did not have a clue , for we all know that is not how it happens
truth is i never stop long enough to care , i can not let myself , and i will not let myself . the risk is just too enormous and from where am standing there are no returns , at all . caring for another human being , letting your heartstrings play to the sound of their heart beat , i call bullshit . why would i let myself loose myself in another person only for me to feel let down if and when the other person does not live up to the idea i had of a perfect relationship
i was when i became a woman . it was a shock , though i had heard of it , nevertheless i was unprepared . it was a painful period , with days bleeding time . i hated to have it , i suffered a lot , at the same time as i was told to be a lucky , since my mum had a more painful period in her childhood . the period was a bad thing , it stopped me to enjoy the life , i had pains , meanwhile i had to hide it from my dad .
yes , i think that playing a role on stage and performing written dialogue when i act does help me with this aspect of my work . i think that it can help you develop an ear for what aspects of verbal storytelling work and hopefully avoid ' clonky ' dialogue . i do n't act out any of my work , but i do like to put myself behind my characters ' eyes and see everything through them in a way that is very similar to the way that you do when trying to get into an acting role .
john i am the living bread that came down out of heaven if anyone eats of this bread , he shall live forever and the bread also which i shall give for the life of the world is my flesh . adam and eve were kept from eating of the tree of life in genesis then the lord god said , behold , the man has become like one of us , knowing good and evil and now , lest he stretch out his hand , and take also from the tree of life , and eat , and live forever
has is really already been weeks it seems likes yesterday that i was taking an at home pregnancy test , reading the positive result , and telling my husband to go buy more tests because the one i had was obviously faulty . thankfully it was nt , but still weeks . the first half of the pregnancy just flew right by . i did nt even get to enjoy most of it because i was so sick , but now that that s all over with i hope that the second half of my pregnancy will be more memorable .
okay , so there 's a group of friends who usually try to do things together two or three times a month . due to not having a job and the price of gas and some other things , i rarely make it more than once a month now . once in a great while , the pilot has us over for dinner . and , usually on the third saturday of december , we exchange gifts . and this is in addition to the official gift exchange at the club , which is also on the that same saturday .
i do believe that the bible has some good stories and some good lessons to teach , just as i believe about many religions . i believe that it shows a unique look at a society or a religious history , for the jewish people , if you are looking at the old testament and it must be read in the context of its time , as a form of history . something even my mother who , unlike my father , can be a bit of a biblical literalist , freely admitted in a conversation with me last night .
my sister came to stay with me once five years ago . i took her on a tour of my house because that is what my mother said i was supposed to do when someone came to my house for the first time . i showed her my living room because it was the first room . i could nt not show it to her because it s the room the front door opens in to . as i took her through the house , she saw all my labels . when we got to my bedroom she started laughing .
ethnic hair will forever remain a mystery to anyone who does not have it , even some people with it . unless you watch good hair , the hilarious documentary done by chris rock that explains a little bit here and there . for the most part though , it is just a mystery . however , there are a few guidelines you should follow when approaching someone with ethnic hair . should you feel the urge to touch , grab , pull , or massage your way through that person s hair , stop and follow these simple rules .
always be polite and professional . do not demand anything from the publisher , such as i wish to hear from you no later than may st or i will find it necessary to look for another publisher . instead , simply end the letter by stating , thank you for your consideration . if you require any additional information , please let me know . i look forward to hearing from you . you will have your contact information on the letter mailing address , email address , phone number if the publisher feels the need to contact you .
about years ago i was in a high school touch football team . it was one of the first times i d ever made a school team , despite trying for several years to get in . i was very excited to be a part of the squad . at the time , i was nt a very good footy player . i d played a lot of park footy , but i d never been a part of a representative team , so i was very aware that if i stuffed up , i d be cut pretty quickly .
the next event that will be taking place is a two day blog hop that i will be participating in that is called what i love about halloween and fall blog hop . this hop takes place on october th and th . there is a great line up of some talented ladies in this hop you are surely not going to want to miss . also you are n't going to want to miss a chance at the thankfully yummy blog candy i will be giving away . so be sure you remember to come and hop with us .
this is a question which we can never really know the answer too , because we can not read the minds of believers , but we can take a pretty good guess . i think that the reason why most believers believe is because it gives them some sort of personal victory , it makes them feel like part of the in crowd . to any conspiracy there are three groups of people . those behind the conspiracies , who are the most evil people on earth , are incredibly powerful and intelligent , but occasionally very , very stupid .
life has been fairly busy recently , but good . lots of work , as always , but more so than usual . we are all supposed to work one saturday a month during the summer , but somehow , i got stuck with in a row . on the plus side , i was able to get a lot of work done . and that 's over i have today , this saturday off i do have one more to go the first saturday of september , but that 's it . from there on out , no more saturdays
it 's always really hard to know what the right decision is to make , i 'm very blessed to have a hubby in a good job and he 's more than happy for me to be flexible and do what i like . i do want to earn money for our household , working gives me a sense of pride , i do like contributing and having my own money , sounds weird as our household money is usually ours but i know if i earn money as well i feel less guilty to donate or buy something i want .
i know it sounds a little silly , a year old woman excited to make new friends . but after three and a half years in this town i can count my friends on one hand . the best part about this young friendship is she has many similar interests . ironically , we met through the gym . i m looking forward to the challenges she will afford me in my running training . i already know she s more in shape than i am , and i m very much looking forward to pushing myself to reach new goals .
the day challenge includes classes per week . we were approached by many women who wanted to do the challenge but could not attend classes per week . therefore we decided to launch the skinny jean challenge which is identical to the day challenge however it is includes classes per week instead of . i am so happy to be able to teach these women how to take control of their life , their eating habits and cycles of good days and bad days and to show them how to have the body they want while enjoying the foods they love .
while wandering around the reception , a chinese woman who barely spoke any english and had two small children came up to me and gestured to a camera . i thought she wanted me to take a picture , but soon realized that she wanted her four year old son to take a picture of her with me . the lady obviously thought i was more important than i really was . her son could barely work the camera , taking a couple of pictures of the ceiling , so i suggested that someone get a picture of all of us .
i m calling this the jenny belt because it s a very s design , and jenny is to me the most s name there is well , other than tiffany . also , my first name is jennifer . so yes , i named this belt after myself , technically . wow that s kind of awkward . anyway , feel free to use the pattern as many times as your heart desires but please do nt make it to sell . i want this to be free to everyone so let s just be fair here , okay okay .
choose to trust jesus with everything . do nt compartmentalize your faith . instead , decide to trust jesus with every part of your life from your relationships to your work . in prayer , give jesus all of your needs , desires , fears , hopes , and dreams , trusting him to handle your concerns and work to give you what s best . this will free you from the pressure of trying to make things work out yourself in the ways you want and the frustration of hitting the limits of your own power to control your life .
it s the time of year when we should all take stock and work out what we really want from life . if certain things are not working they way we want them to , we need to sit back for a minute or two and reflect where it s going wrong . perhaps it s time to change directions , to think outside the box . it s time to get focused on where we are and where we want to be . because , after all , we are holding the key to our future in our own hands .
we have made some very good changes in our house and they have definitely made an impact on our boys as well they see us making the healthier choices and they want to copy our positive habits yay with a new diet , i have had to become very flexible with my meal plans because it 's not always easy to plan a day 's worth of meals with a busy schedule , preschool , sports , and being a wife and mother and we all have busy lives , so i 'm sure this is tough for most of you too
the first row design goes live on tuesday , july th and we ll have another one each monday after that for the next four weeks . start collecting a nice background fabric and a pile of focus fabrics . you probably need about yards of background fabric , more if you decide to make a bigger quilt . and then some focus fabrics i obviously used fat quarters . someone used yardage of their favorite designer , another used a layer cake , and another used up a bunch of her adorable scraps in an attempt to further d stash .
i am self published . i m a bit of a control freak and i like having the total creative control over my work . no one is going to be as passionate about my books as i am . no one is going to care as deeply about how they are presented or marketed . no publisher is going to believe in them as much as i do . if my books are good , they ll find an audience . if they re not , they wo nt . i m not against traditional publishing . for me , it
this verse means a lot to me in this season of our lives . in a way , we feel like our family is in transition . we 're relying on god to show us what is next in our life . to our surprise , both of us felt lead to go back to school . for me , it is to help run our side business . and for my husband , it is so he can further his career . as the months go by , i 'm sure we 'll know more as god reveals his plan for us
when i am with him i see the way that things are supposed to be . he shows concern for me , worries about me driving long distances , cares when i am sick , asks about my day , and never makes me feel less than i am . when i am with him i feel like i can do anything . i feel calm and care free . i long for the days that i can see him and when we part i feel such sadness . although we email every day i maybe see him only times a month .
additionally , you 'll find if you look deeply , the topics i 'm researching . most of them are just fine but what about the links and information i 'm putting in my next book i 've worked hard for what is in my head , do i want you to be able to see everything there before it is published in my next book would it put me in breach of my publishing contract i 'm not totally sure but then again , i 'm not totally unsure either it is enough of a question to bother me , however .
i m not exactly sure how to describe what happens to me after i come back from japan , but it s been the same both times i come back and the contrast between my life here and what i had did learned in japan is so strong that it takes me a while to get back into the flow of my normal life . i m not depressed , although it feels that way a little bit . it s more like having to come down from some kind of excellent high , but without all of the bad side effects .
something suddenly happened yesterday not like i wanted it to happen . but at night , i still craft . i do not know for many of you , but for me crafting could act like a medicine in the sense that crafting could help me ease my mind . at least a bit if not completely . i did not think much when i created this page but i had to tell you how easy it was to create something straight from the heart without referring to any challenge . after all , that is why the challenge being called a challenge
i made a drawing of a weird tree . it had blue leaves , pink fruits , and a purple trunk . i drew a girl who had corresponding colorful features . she had blue hair , pink eyes , and purple skin . she was the guardian of the tree , and so she was the only one who could pick a fruit from the tree . anyone else who tried to get climb the tree to get its fruits would die . the fruits never fell to the ground . anyone who was given the fruit would have immense power .
i like to call old school marketing spray and pray that s not a term i made up . you blast messages out to the public . you try your best to target that content to the people you think want to hear it , but really it s about bulk . get as many people to hear the message as possible , understanding that only a small percentage will convert to sales . the knowledge you have about those people and their opinion of your product or your marketing efforts are basically good guesses . sometimes they are pretty bad guesses .
neely and i have been going through dry stage . it 's really nothing new for us , most of our marriage has been extremely challenging for both of us , but lately it has seemed especially strong and in our face . i 'm sure many of you have your own struggles within your marriage . marriage is somewhat set up to be difficult . you take two completely different people who grew up with two different backgrounds in many cases and you put them under the same roof and hope for the best . it sounds a lot like reality tv
today 's here is what i really am a mom , a wife , a sister , a friend , a person . i 'm all that stuff just do n't have the title , lol . i laugh , i might be sad . i have a serious side even though those who know me might think i always laugh . life is real , life can be hard at times but through everything there is a real place a heaven where we can live forever . i wait for that wonderful day ca n't wait to see that real place .
i have this funny effect on a few people . occasionally i ll meet see sleep with someone , and they will never forget it . it sounds vain to say so but actually i think most other people just have a much better memory than i do . so every now and again one of these people will ring me , out of the blue , and say , hello rose , it s me how are you as if we only just met last week and were good mates . when in fact , we met a very long time ago .
my question is should i ask her about it if my charge does have this condition i would be able to do research . i would be able to help him with skills , learning , and communication in more effective ways . or should i just leave it and let mb come to me should i tell mb what else n had told me about my year old charge i know i should just leave it alone but i want to help this child more effectively . but i also do nt want to add fuel to the fire . thank you .
april th pray for sweet emma . no one was sure little emma would survive when she came to sarah s covenant homes this past fall . thank god for the fact that she has , indeed , survived and has gotten a lot healthier she will never be anywhere near normal unless god chooses to perform a miracle in her , but pray that she will know she is loved . caution this picture is pretty graphic . the photo on the left is emma after coming to the home , and the picture on the right shows the improvements she has made
the more i read , the more frustrated i am by this culture of meanness that we live in . as a culture , we are really mean to kids , especially teenagers . these broken kids end up at our house and i see beautiful people , where their parents see kids that they may love , but are not measuring up . why why why that is such a horrible place for kids to live in the hearts of their parents , to never measure up to perceived expectations . more thoughts on this here from someone else who really gets it
this song always made me think a lot about love . it was , after all , i was years old and the talk of love was everywhere . i was so curious . it seemed everybody else knew what love was like , everyone except me . there it was on tv , for god s sake . even advertising talked about it , i was nt sure if i would ever experience love , after all , who was going to love someone like me my mother told me , i d have a difficult time finding anybody to love me .
as a child i loved mixing things up when i got the chance in the kitchen , a lot of my love for cooking came from my grandmother , although a lot of her cooking was very heavy . i have grown over the years to love to cook with fresh veggies and mix unique things together which create a wonderful flavor . when my oldest was old enough to help out in the kitchen i encouraged her to jump in and help as i feel this helped create a basic understanding of cooking , skill and taught her a bit about creativity .
hi everyone . can you believe we are in may already nearly half way through the year . where has the time gone well with the new month comes a new lot of challenges . this is my dt layout for this months kraft it up challenge . this months criteria is to ask either your kids or hubby what easter means to them . now , i thought long hard about this question , not wanting to get heavy in a public forum , then i came across these pics of a friend on mines little one , my question was answered .
just as an aside , cause this has been very helpful in my life if someone s act or words are coming from love , it s personal , if an act towards you is not based in love , it s not personal , it s about them . fear is never personal . if it feels personal , then we must have something within ourselves that matches the words or actions and that is a great opportunity to wake up to that . thank the person and move on lol , so easy to say , so much more difficult to do
now comes the hardest part of this post . we have to say goodbye to one of our sweet and beyond talented sisters of the challenge team . pat , has to step down from her position due to health issues and it is with a sad heart and lots of tears that i am writing this . pat , i will miss you my friend i know you 'll have to do what is best for you and i pray that god will heal those hands of yours and that you will be back when the time is right love you sis .
these are kristen 's biggest problems at school . today was her last full day of school . on friday , we have the singing program and then she is done for the summer . as i was waiting in the car line today , one of the directors came over to chat with me . kristen decided she kept needing to try to hold the little boy 's hand next to her during practice , felt like she needed to pull her dress up a couple times , and sang most of the time . what more can i do to help her
i know this might be all over the place a little but the general point is this . its been a year since we have joined the pages and we still believe in kevin and that he is really the right man for the job . we the people trust him and want him back where he belongs and we are refusing to give up until he s there . i am originally from the usa and never really had an interest in politics and all until now . here the sitting members are so much more accessible than back in the states .
we are so proud of him and all that he has done this year he has turned into an amazing reader and has started taking an interest in chapter books . he would never admit it , but singing is one of his favorite things to do . he has made so many new friends at school this year and has had an absolute blast going . i think he is still under the impression that school is just a time to get together and play with his buds and all that learning stuff is just something they do on the the side .
from menu planning shopping system , you might think i m a control freak . well , that would be partially true , but i also love getting to the market and finding out that something new is available . if i ve planned my menu right see below , i may be able to add something unexpected into our menu . or maybe it becomes a lunch snack . i can also make a note of it and work it in next week . the point is , do nt make yourself so controlled that you miss the beauty of the market .
this takes us down to three days left of the school year . i am happy to be here as a substitute rather than a regular teacher . last year at this time , i was busy with grades , inventory , packing up personal items , moving out of the room and just plain getting out of there . i still need to sort some of the boxes in the basement . maybe that can be part of my assignment when it is really hot this summer . that cold basement will seem like a pretty nice place to be at that time .
it was good to see the rest of the family . but i have to admit i 'm still tired . i decided to tackle the hallway yesterday which is a small part of what i yet want to clean out . i have the hallway closet still and then my craft computer room . i have n't felt up to doing it and now that i do , i need to be getting ready for the holidays instead but how do you do that when the most important room to the holidays craft room is a mess lol it 'll all work out .
i have plans to help us our department to work better and i wish others felt as strongly as i did about getting ourselves more organised . i can see the workshop potentially pushing out more jobs within its shifts than we currently do but sometimes it feels like i m the only one who understands that this is possible . if i was to have a little co operation from people in leadership roles we could complete not just the jobs that are brought to our attention during the day but we could also start chipping away at the pile of outstanding ones .
i was a complete wreck the first time i went to see you . i did nt know how i d react , i did nt know if seeing me would upset you , and i did nt know what i would do if i looked you in the eyes and saw that you were not ok . i seriously drove down for that main reason to look you in the eyes and make sure you were ok . an added bonus when i got here was to make you smile and laugh . i would drive twice as far to do that for you .
walk gently on the earth , love as widely as possible , smile at all you meet , and remember that you must fill your own well first to have something to give to others . the garden will feed you , as will little animals , as will cooking a meal , waving to a neighbor , helping one person each day in the smallest of ways . i wish you days filled with joy , and rivers of happiness . i wish you love . i send it from my little cottage to you , wherever you are . i wish you peace .
i do remember a time when i was in alaska and my family was the only ones in our branch . we would have a testimony meeting each first sunday of the month and we were to share our beliefs . because there were normally only or of us , we would each have the opportunity to share each time . as a teenager , there were times that i did not want to share . but the hard part was if i was the last one to speak , all of the others would sit there and stare at me until i said something .
and yet . i am acutely aware of the unique magic of this time , this pre baby period when we still have no idea what we 're in for . when all we can do is imagine what our son will look like , be like , become . when his every move is still like a little secret between the two of us . i may never be pregnant again and , at any rate , will never be pregnant again with this baby and i want to do everything i can to hold onto it in ways that i will appreciate later .
as a good writer , you already have the ability to write concise , interesting , and funny prose . that 's all twitter is . it should be a breeze for you to build a following of people that includes literary agents and book editors that can assist you in getting the word out about your work , or offer you a deal if you do n't have one . do n't use this as a chance to hit them over the head with your book just demonstrate what a good writer you are and they will want to read it on their own .
of course you have made many mistakes along the way . you now realise of taking your own approval and agreement before signing onto anything . you now realise the importance of not saying yes when someone asks you to say yes . you now realise the importance of not going along with the crowd on every issue . you now realise the importance of standing up for your thoughts . you realise , it is one life and you need to make the most of it . it is your life . yours only . not to be bartered away for someone s needs .
why is it that you are single and so many of your friends are married or why ca nt you find a job or why does it seem like your child is the only one who ca nt sit still for more than two seconds or why do you have to have major surgery answer because god knows exactly what you need to become more like jesus for his glory and your joy and he has designed your life accordingly . your hardships are specifically designed for you and my hardships are specifically designed for me with loving intent , perfect clarity and an all powerful hand
i know that for the most part i m talking to a wall here . the people who agree with me are dealing with the same issues my husband and i are dealing with , and the people who do nt agree are nt going to listen to anything i have to say anyway . so i guess in the end all i can say is that its a frustrating situation . i know my husband and i are nt the only one s dealing with it , but in this sort of case knowing there are others having the same issue is nt exactly comforting .
weird and seriously weird , appear to be the order of the day , these days . a few days ago , i noticed that spring was here . that s something i have always been able to sense . several days later , it is obvious that spring has arrived . it comes earlier in this part of europe than most anywhere else , except the far south . this is only tangentially connected to my point those change in seasons . it does nt matter that it is spring . it could be any season . it is the change factor that is important .
now let 's talk about bob . bob was n't married , and so he did n't worry too much about how much money he was making because he did n't have a family to support . he did n't have many expenses . he just earned a small pay and lived quite comfortably himself , until he married when he was quite a bit older . as soon as he married , he began earning more and doing better for himself . but had he worked hard and demanded fair pay when he was , he would be in a much better financial situation today .
all i can say is that we sure did nt see things the same way i saw no other outcome or consequence to his crimes , lies and other betrayals , than divorce . not to mention the fact that every attorney involved advised me to cut my ties to the criminal as fast as i possibly could , for my protection and for my children . regardless of how i felt or what i may or may not have wanted to do , i did nt have a choice . my former husband had made my choice for me and left me with no choice .
for the last several years , i have not had an end to my trials , but i have found that my difficulties in this life are truly blessings from god , meant to make me more like his son , and to bring god glory . my body is much more ill now , but my soul is so much healthier . i would not choose to go back and exchange my health of years ago with my health of today , because , through the pain and trials , i have learned that my relationship with christ greatly outweighs any suffering in this world .
larry do n't say it . do n't you fucking say you 're too good for me . i am , but do n't say it . you 're making the mistake of your life . you 're leaving me because you believe that you do n't deserve happiness , but you do , anna . larry did you have a bath because you had sex with him so you would n't smell of him . so you 'd feel less guilty larry how do you feel anna guilty . larry did you ever love me anna yes . he starts crying . she embraces him .
suitable for these jeans in fact , is incredible . i have little doubt that the whole concept . many times in the past , some brands have already said their jeans suitable amazing , but there is not much difference , but it is not the case here . i am really shocked to discover that in fact they will do everything . i chose the lean , because i like a lower growth they are in different cuts and rising . these approximately . rise , leg opening around the crotch . all this for me is perfect , this is what i love my jeans
the main idea behind the book is that for centuries human beings , technology , society and culture have evolved very slowly . the pace of change was so slow that within few generations that change was not visible . but last century changed all that . people were able to perceive the changes within same generation . in the last few decades the changes became so fast for a particular generation that future was coming as shock to people . i have myself now seen these changes happening within last few years and i could clearly see why these changes are to be called as shock .
so often i find myself in situations where i am surrounded by people that , under normal circumstances , i would never be friends with . i currently have this situation here in spain , but it is definitely not the first time i have experienced it . and when i find myself in these situations it takes all my self control to be civil , and to smile , and engage is small talk , and satisfy their needs for human interaction , and i feel so totally drained that i want to run away and hide somewhere that these people will never find me again .
i 'm not going to measure my success on how others think of me . the success in my life is reflected by how my family views me . just like the article above states , my children love me , and they do n't care how good i am at braiding hair or baking cakes they think the world of me . they are smart and they are learning so much every day . that 's how i measure my success , teaching them the things they need to know , and loving them . however , they 're teaching me more than i 'm teaching them
i know not all of us are married . maybe we 're married and we do n't have the marriage we would like . maybe we hope to be married again or to meet the one or maybe we love the single life . despite where we are in our relationships , i know we all have people we love . hearing polly 's joy and perspective , and hearing her tell funny stories after being in so much emotional pain through the years , makes me realize that , despite the intense hurt we may feel at times , the sun really will come out tomorrow .
when i first started this job almost a year ago , some of the first things i was told i would need to learn , but only i could through experience , was to be aware of my surroundings and to be always watching what s happening around the bar , even doing so without making it obvious i am . more seriously then that though , i would have to learn how to handle the situation if a fight ever broke out or if a customer became violent and aggressive . learning these things was never going to be the most fun aspect of the job .
yesterday evening i saw this fox in the garden . this is the first fox i have managed to photograph , though i have seen them in the field behind our garden , this is the first one to venture into the garden . i believe this is a young one and appears to be in the process of getting it 's winter coat , after exploring the garden he came right up to the shed just a few feet from my window . these shots were taken through the window as i knew if i had opened the door he she , would have run off .
i know some of you are wondering if i ve lost touch with reality . you may be thinking , what i would nt do just to get my husband to take out the trash or wash the dishes . she s nuts the issue for me is not whether or not chores get done or if i can rely on dave s help at home . instead , i m concerned about spending time together . we ve actually agreed to put all work aside by noon on weekends just to guarantee time is spent doing what is necessary at home and necessary for our relationship .
i m amazed at how many golf courses out there make it easy for kids to get into golf . i wished i grew up when courses were offering free golf to kids . this just in , shadow hills is an absolutely beautiful course in sun city , one of the desert communities in palm springs . there are two courses there , the north course and south course . recently the north course was expanded to holes but is the shorter of the two . it does nt play like an executive course because it has lots of water and sand like the south course .
greenpeace even lost it s tax free status from what was a very green canadian government in . this is clearly a step that should be taken by everyone against all of the green organizations , which is now big business . this may be changing now , but for years the green movement worldwide took in more money that of the world s nations , and no trade organization in the world could stand against them financially . that can only continue as long as they can convince everyone that everything mankind is doing is so destructive to the planet that it will become damaged beyond repair .
another good way to find people is by checking out others following and followers lists . find out who they like to follow and who s following them . once you follow someone , they may decide to follow you back . you 'll do the same for your new followers check your list now and then and see if you 'd like to follow back the people who are following you . if you 're not interested in following them back , you do n't have to do anything , but if they 're so creepy you do n't even want them following you , hit block .
i am a self taught artist . i have always drawn pictures and loved making things since i was a kid . i just never stopped . it s pretty cool to be a grown up and still be able to just play and mess around making stuff . i have kids of my own now and they are a constant source of inspiration and its fun being able to connect with your kids making things and constantly creating . i dont work in any specific medium . i think my lack of a formal education makes me endlessly curious about what you can use to make art .
j 's demob wrapped up quicker than we expected , which was very welcome news i had an idea late last week that he would be finished early and that i would be able to pick him up sunday afternoon . since the kids still did not know that he was back , we decided to keep the secret a little longer and i arranged for them to stay with a friend sunday who would also drive them to school monday morning . it was nice to have a little longer time than our previous one hour to spend alone together before i had to share his time .
they met the next day , and they talked about love , poetry , and shakespeare . they met every day to talk about love , poetry , and shakespeare . and every day , beth listened to and loved james s views on what it meant to love and to be loved . every answer he gave made sense to the girl , and before long , it became apparent to beth that the ownership of her soul had been transferred from shakespeare s possession into james s . and that possession , if it did nt fill the missing piece , at least led to forgetfulness .
many of you know that my husband served almost years in the navy . at times it was hard , but i am so thankful for all that time taught us as a couple . i am so thankful for the friendships that were formed from those days of being in the military . many of those friendships still remain today . i am so thankful for the job career that the navy trained my husband for today . i am so very thankful that i was a navy wife in those early years of our marriage . i know the cost , and i am still thankful .
while we were in ca we spent a day in san francisco . i have n't been there since my senior year in high school when i went with my art history group . last time it was shortly after and we were n't allowed near the golden gate bridge so that was a must for me this trip . it was pretty incredible up close . we also went to pier and golden gate park not quite what we expected , but not too bad . jen and i left the sleeping girls with her friend so we could go see the hunger games later that night .
this is my senior year of high school . i have only a month left , and i have learned a lot about life . i have learned that simply being human is what connects us all . i have learned that you must always ask why , and you must never stop . i have learned that dreams are what make life worth living , but that just because you dream them , it does nt mean they come true . and in the end , when the world says no , you can either take it , or you can decided for yourself who you are .
when your child is young , you are the only one with a choice in the relationship . you have choices about how to parent . you can parent with fear , constantly trying to manipulate your child to be exactly who you want her to be . you can use shame and guilt to attempt to control your child . or you can parent with trust , trying to allow your child to be and to love who she already is . you can use love and support and control yourself . either way you choose , your child has to stick with you while she is young .
i have to suffer this agent route , where half of them do not bother even answering me . i have to suffer the fact that my query letter must be one page , printed , sent in an envelope , and then wait months for an answer . then i have to wait until the agent does find a publisher . if they find a publisher . then i have to wait another year before the book may come out , if it is not cancelled . then i have to market my own book which i have to do anyway if i self publish . so forget that
the book , one yard wonders has been around for awhile , heck i have had it for about a year and i am just now getting around to making something out of it . it is a great book with some really neat projects . i love the premise of the book , everything in the book can be made with one yard of fabric or less and for the most part everything is fairly easy to make . it is just a great book that really makes sewing seem like something that is doable for everyone . check it out if you have n't had a chance .
i ca n't believe how this year is flying by , once again it is getting closer to christmas and i have n't booked a single christmas fair . i really do need to get a bit more organised for next year and at least do a couple . i do n't know but i 'm not sure if the fair thing is for me , but i do need to get my work in front of a bigger audience . folksy has gone a bit quiet , but then again i ca n't expect miracles as it 's ages since i have put anything new in my shop .
tattoo guy in case you have nt read the about page , he is my calm , cool , and collected life partner said do nt worry about it , baby who cares what she thinks . you re trying to spread a message that is important to you , and probably to a lot of other women too . and , you know , she only has the power to upset you if you give it to her . excellent point and after thinking about it , i came to the conclusion that he s absolutely right . wow , my man is a total zen master in training
the story was a little hard to get into , at first . but the chapters are really quick , and really short . they end on little cliffhangers a lot , and skip from character to character a great deal , which keeps you reading to find out what happens . things start getting into some interesting twists about of the way into the book . it keeps moving along at a good pace , but it does nt tire you out . the politics are nt very dense . it s more action oriented . the characters are all very human , and tend to screw up sometimes .
i had a great time at the party . all my mom friends overwhelmed me with compliments about how great i look . it felt good to be recognized for all the hard work . i 've still got a ways to go in my brain catching up with my body but i 'm working on it . one of my friends gave me a workout outfit that does n't fit her thanks jackie . the top is too small for me but the shorts are great . and hopefully the top will fit eventually . i got home a bit after pm and pretty much went straight to bed .
due to our weakness , our prayers are probably not always perfect , but we are assured by god that he will answer our prayers without fail , but the result may not be exactly as we want . if you are a loving parent will you give a stone to eat when your child asks for bread or a snake for a fish this means that god , in his love for us , will not give us a stone in the place of bread , and from this we can draw the corollary nor will he give us a stone if we ask for stone instead of bread .
i do n't normally write short stories . there 's a reason . i want to go on and on with the story , get into every one 's heads as to what they are doing and make the plot twist and turn and ... well , that 's impossible to do with a short story . the novel and short story may seem similar to some , but they are very different . you have to tell a story within so many pages like five or eight or ten . we 're given a , words max , so i 've got more than enough pages to play with .
debby who is now the jelly roll queen , is going to do a workshop on layer cakes , she has a few ideas up her sleeve , but i thought i would have a go . there seems to be lots of patterns out there for jelly rolls , but the layer cakes always seem more difficult to find . the one i have done is really easy . i thought i liked the layer cake i used , until i started to make it the top is completed so i just need to get it ready to quilt , which i aim to do during the christmas break .
that quote describes my life pretty well right now . it has been a little over a month since i have written a new post because life decided to happen to me . a month ago today , my month old great nephew came to live with me while his parents work some things out in their lives . to say this was a big change might just be the understatement of the century . i have gone from living alone , doing what i want when i want , to caring for this small child who just needs someone to pay attention to him and help him learn to explore .
needless to say , nothing has come back , no phone call as promised , and when i called the store it was the same lady . she wrote it in her diary to call me but we have n't got to that page yet . if i really wanted to go ahead anyway i 'd have to deal directly with head office . call the number and press when the options were being read out . i did this . there is no option it starts the options being read out again . lied to again all the other options just ring and then ask you to leave a message .
yesterday the world lost an amazing man , but heaven gained one amazing angel . the man who has been an extra grandfather to me my whole life passed away yesterday , and my heart is full of sadness over the loss . every time i realize i wo n't hear his voice again or see his smile brings unbelievable pain . there may have not been blood binding our families together , but he is my grandfather in every other sense of the world . we do n't need blood to form the strongest bonds in our world . we need love , and mr. u had that in abundance .
on the occasions that we do see each other , honey will usually travel to me , we 'll plug in a couple of guitars and without even speaking we 'll ' jam ' , for want of a better word , for hours at a time . even though much of that stuff never makes it to tape , it can be magical . as i say , i 'm no musician , but honey is about the only person i can feel comfortable enough with to pretend i am one . she is very generous in that respect and seems to enjoy those moments as much as i do .
another great thing about living alone is that you must take responsibility for everything . this means that you must make sure that all bills are paid on time and that the dish is complete and the floor will be vacuumed . many people simply can not do this unless there is someone there to tell them to do so . if you are the type who needs to be told to go to work then it is probably not a good idea to live alone . you 'll almost certainly find that you will forget to pay the bills is important and it will lead to all sorts of problems .
the other happens when you express some thoughts of suicide , or wanting to do something anything to stop feeling the pain . many people respond to that by telling you to think of how your suicide would affect other people friends , family , lovers , children . you know what if you killed yourself , it would have a tragic , long lasting impact on the people around you . i know , because i have had people i cared about kill themselves , too . you can use the pain your death would cause others as a reason not to do it , if that works for you .
so , do i see myself as a mother someday one way or another either through the good old fashioned way , artificial insemmination or adoption , the answer is yes . still i stand by my original philosophy that nothing will happen until it is time to happen . and for those of you whose time has come , congratulations . know that whatever you do , however you do it , even if you choose to give your blessing away to people who you know are better equipped to care for them , it is always right , and through birth or adoption , you are a mother nonetheless .
before i share the journal entry she wrote , she wants to make sure that you understand where her heart was and what she was thinking at the time she wrote this . you see , she d been praying for years for god to change her husband . she wanted god to make her husband into a man who was worthy of her . but after four years of praying this and receiving no answer from god , she changed her prayer for the next two years . she felt he was dead weight and was holding her back from her potential to becoming the most holy and perfect woman alive .
the truth of the matter is that the reason ms. perfect has n't appeared has nothing to do with your luck , good or bad , but everything to do with you and the fact that you are busy looking for a person that does n't exist you ca n't date with your eyes closed and some impossible dream in your head . you 'll get so caught up in this whole exercise of dating that you forget to look for the qualities you seek you have n't met the person of your dreams because you are n't looking for the things that will make them close enough to perfect for you .
this is a good thing . if people wo nt listen to you then no one is going to buy from you and ultimately you ll find yourself in a lonely life wondering what is going wrong . maybe you feel lonely now and this information is hitting a little close to home . if you find yourself lonely on a regular basis ask yourself if people are rejecting you or your ideas knowing your buyer is huge in making sales . and if you are not making sales then you either need to change your buyers or change your pitch . sometimes you even have to do a little of both .
. champions apply what they learn immediately . see , the goal of learning is not knowledge , it is application how long it took me before i realized this . when you know truth , really know it , it s supposed to set you free . that s what jesus taught in john . apply truth to your life . observe to do , not to quote , teach or share that is when it begins to bless your life see joshua james . it was from bill gates i learnt that you should act on your idea or new knowledge within the first twenty four hours of catching it .
of course i do n't want to give the marketing department or captain smith a hard time . it 's easy to speak of these things now ... because we know the end of the story . my point is just to make a point sometimes we need to stop being stubborn . we need to stop marketing a parenting project or at least point out it 's flaws . we also need to stop seeking praise for our efforts , when we really need to pay attention to the warning signs . we also need to keep our minds and hearts open for any important messages that are trying to come through .
to me , that sounds a bit crazy . i know there are couples in this world who can work their romantic partnership as well as their business partnership , but it does nt sound like fun to me to be spending so much time together that is focused on work . i believe that i would appreciate dating someone who provides a respite from work . i would enjoy hearing about my significant other s day at work and telling him about mine . and i could have a legitimate reason to not care about the details of his day . i m guessing he would appreciate the same about my day .
do you do christmas lights at your house i 've never really been into decorating our place with lights out the front . mainly because it 's a big enough job to get the christmas tree and lights up inside the house , let alone have time for the outside . i do like the idea of it , but it would also mean hubby would have to set it all up and i do n't like the idea of the extra electricity expense either there are a few houses around us that like to get into the christmas spirit with lights on their houses . maybe one day we will join in .
it is those days that i become aware of how remote i feel . though i am not farther away from home than i was in seattle , i feel like living at the end of the world here . of course , there is the time difference . while in seattle , we were or hours behind europe , now we are only or hours behind . so in seattle , i could do all my phone or skype calls in the mornings and then head out , whereas here , my phone calls happen in the middle of the day which makes it more difficult . but that s not it .
that was a knife to my heart . i felt that i had failed her , because it had been on my mind to do for quite some time clearly for a reason . i just did not think she would need it yet . then i remembered some of what i experienced in high school . i remembered the situations i was in , and how mean others could be . i realized that i , too , could have used this advice at that time in my life . so , with that said , i am finally getting around to doing what i should have done months and months ago .
i followed the project emma did for days to make me a better person and decided i wanted to do one too . i did n't want it to be to do with writing . i thought it would be a good idea to have a break from writing for a while . i wanted it to be to do with noticing things , and trying to retrain my brain to be more positive than it is . i do n't know if it will work . i also wanted to try and get better at taking pictures . i 'm not good at it at all , although i wish i was .
it 's wednesday , and i have been thinking about my trip and that beer since saturday . as i sit here , and write out this post , i am finishing off my final , and last flying dog dogtoberfest . it 's a little bitter sweet . i 'm enjoying it more than i did on saturday , and possibly a little more than i did last october . but i know it will soon be over . once i finish it , that 's it . there is no more . all the bottles i had , visible and hidden are gone . and it is n't even july yet .
i 'll get some pictures up as soon as i get them loaded onto my computer . the other day was the first time i had picked my camera up in weeks i just needed a break things were going way too fast for me , and i did n't feel i was ready for where it was taking me . people were asking me left and right to do family pictures , baby pictures , birthday pictures and while i love that they love my photos , i'm not where i want to be yet , and i do n't want to give anything to anyone that i 'm not happy with myself .
then i came to the present moment and thought all those experiences in your life challenging or not were there because later in life you may go through something way harder or just hard and feel like its never going to end and that s when you can look back and think about the times when you did make it through , you were strong , you were determined and you made it so you can make it through this rough spot life has so many unanswered questions and so many different roads you can take think if you do nt trust yourself enough to lead you right , who are you going to trust
happy thanksgiving week , everyone , and welcome to the official beginning of the holiday season when i think about the many things i 'm grateful for , one of the most important is this challenge and the opportunity it 's given me to meet so many incredible artists who 've now become incredible friends as well thank you all for sharing your talent , your humor and your words with me . i 'm humbled every single day by the beauty you create and the heart and soul you put into your art , and i 'll never be able to thank you enough for allowing me to share this experience with you .
ben 's brother had to do the makeup exams for the bac , and the results were posted online this morning , and he passed except now you ca n't see the results . so hopefully it was n't a computer error and they posted everyone passed and then took it down when they realized what happened but he did really well in the english makeup and only needed about one point in math to pass , so i think he probably did . still , we stressed the poor boy quite a bit waking him up early to tell him we saw his name only to have it taken down a few minutes later
the ' negative space ' in art is the room around the subject , which is sometimes called ' positive space ' then . the room around the subject in food photography is often filled by props and side elements . and the props and side elements can become subjects on their own supporting the main subject the food . in general one would not call this negative space , because it is filled with ' side ' subjects , although it is possible that this background and side elements work as negative space in some way . more obvious is the negative space , when it seems to be ' empty ' too .
we are having some amazingly mild weather lately , and from what i 've been reading , so has a lot of the country . i 'd say many of us are due some mild weather after a year of real extremes . i 've been seeing posts and hearing people talking about some of the plants that are already showing buds or making their way up through the soil . as much as i love seeing those signs of spring i 'm a little nervous that we could and probably will get some really cold weather . some plants will be fine either way , but there are some that might not be .
sealed is a format where players are given a number of boosters to open . with these cards you need to create your own deck , you do nt need to choose a hero at the start . the best thing to do here is look at the cards you have , see how they could work together and after that you can say which hero you take . it s a good way for beginning players to start , as they get to keep the cards they received from the boosters . also the more experienced players do nt have the upper hand because they need to play with these cards as well .
i believe the lord has laid a few things on my heart today with your help that have been of great comfort and encouragement to me . one of the things that was on my mind was the judgment seat of christ , the day of judgment . this came to my mind when you mentioned the verses in matthew below . i am sure that when it comes to this subject you probably know a lot more than i do , and there is probably a whole lot of scripture that speaks about it . however , i wanted to look at that passage from matthew as well as another passage . here they are
so when i got a call from someone who introduced himself as a reporter from the sand paper , i knew what he meant . he asked me some questions about my writing and my book and my upcoming visit at the lbi library . this was about a week before we left for the beach , and in the days leading up to it , i could nt find any article on the sand paper s site that mentioned me , so i did nt know if it had run . in fact , by the time we arrived on the island , i d forgotten there was even the possibility of a story .
he said , you know its killing her right now because she thinks you hate her , i replied that i did hate her . he said , maybe you do right now but you do love her to . i said that no i did nt . he asked , why because she left because she said she would always be here and then she left i ignored him , but yes , of course that was why . in my head , i did nt fucking need her , i did nt need anyone , they never do what they say they will , she left and i was fucking done with her .
swimming ethan loves water from the very beginning he has loved bath time and still does . while peter has learned to crawl , ethan seems to be a fish out of water . his mode of getting around is the butterfly stroke . it 's so funny to watch not only is he doing the butterfly , but he gets so excited when he sees something he wants , turns himself towards it , and then starts his stroke to get there , making excited little noises the whole time . and it keeps going and going since his attention is very quickly caught by something else the moment he reaches his original destination .
as you are thinking about your overall family emergency response plan , take a hard look at anything on your list that contains the words bug out . for you , a plan that involves an immediate or delayed bug out may be the best solution to some problem my family does nt have . but i urge you to think about what threats you are running from , where you are running to , and what the reality of walking away from your home would really look like before you spend time , money , and energy on bug out resources that may not support your preparedness goals or increase your chances of survival .
this is perhaps the key point that authors should be aware of . the author still has to provide his or her own cover image , with stock images coming at an addition cost . for a book intended as a book for family and friends and without distribution , this does not seem good value , though , it could be argued that an author might be happy with supplying their own images . still , it seems to stretch what the interpretation of a custom designed cover actually is . to other author solution service companies this would mean an in house designed cover with the author not being required to supply images .
while many of my stories have had some humor , or some strange angle to them , there is still some general success in them , and none of them make me look nearly as bad as this one . but , if you ca nt laugh at yourself , you re doing something wrong . while this may not have been one of my finest hours , i m sure many of you will get a kick out of it . also , this is the first story of mine that does not take place in a sexual situation . i guess i m expanding my repertoire a bit . this story is from june .
about a year and half ago , we were talking about traveling and how much we want to see and experience in this world . every year for the past few years we go to the life is good unschooling conference . every time we go some where for that length of time , the kids miss the cats and home . we love being at home so much , but we love going places so much . well i had heard of families living on the road full time and started reading more about it . it looked amazing exactly what we were looking for , to be able to travel without really leaving home .
since they are just plans , and we have weeks until marathon weekend , i 'm sure we will change our minds several times on what we will be doing that weekend . however , three out of the four of us will be racing , that much i do know jacob wo n't be racing , but that is only because he is not yet three . i 'm sure he will start racing as soon as he is old enough my only concern is not getting enough sleep for the nights before the marathon . however , i do n't get a lot of sleep now , so maybe i 'll be used to it
please know that it was always my intention to do an honest job for the authors that i worked with . i know how much your hard work means to you . i also know how hard you worked for the money that you invested to receive publishing and promotional services that you expected to be provided especially when i promised you that the work you paid for would be done . at the time i sold you these services , i truly believed that you were paying for legitimate services that were being provided by the owners of the company . when i realized this was nt the case , i made the decision to leave .
lately , school has been pretty intense and it looks like it will remain that way through this semester . originally i planned on basically closing down the blog until may , but i think for now i will leave it up . i just do n't have the time to craft like i would like , but that said i do have projects in the works and things to share . i just wo n't be able to post quite as often and will have to rely on scheduled posts and older projects i have n't shared . and i also expect that finished projects will be few and far between over the next few months .
you may want to know how the hell does a beer reach those levels of alcohol . there is no yeast strain that can live in that type of environment so they have to be creative . basically what they do is brew up a normal strong ale , then use a process somewhat like distillation . since alcohol has a much lower freezing temperature than water does , the beer is frozen and the ice is taken out of the batch . they repeat the process over and over again until they have what they are looking for . the german 's originally came up with the process , and you can read about it here .
at am , i wake up but stay in bed trying to find motivation to get up . i finally get up and decide to take a shower before the kids wake up . but the two little ones who moved into our bed last night violet at about am and hunter at about am wake up as soon as i move my warm body away from them . they love to cuddle which i love and hate at the same time . i know this time will pass and they wo n't want to cuddle with me anymore but i love my sleep too . here is what the kids looked like when they woke up .
on the site , you can read the requests for pictures by the prisoners . some ask for family photos , others ask for jesus . or , like the above picture , some want images of themselves dropped into a background that highlights hope , love , or something more . a few men just want something funny to look at . it s strange to think about a photograph as a privilege , but when you re denied everything else , a single image can be the difference between salvation and insanity . if you want to pitch in and maybe change someone s life , join me in sending photos by following this link .
so , why start a blog well , i have a few reasons there . first up , i enjoy writing , and when i decided to start this little blog , i could n't understand why i had n't done this before . until i got everything set up , started writing this post , and hit the wall of writer 's block . it 's hard to not want to make every sentence perfect to make every thought crystal clear . but i 'm working on it , and i 'm excited to get started . first posts are always the hardest . and i 'm not entirely sure what i should be saying here .
i love people . i need people . somedays after being around people , i want to crawl in a hole and get away from everyone . some days , my work makes me feel sad . part of the sadness is for people who say mean things to me or someone else . more of the sadness is for people who are in shit so deep that neither of us can see a way out . the most sadness i feel is for the people who have given up on life . they do nt want to try anything or go anywhere . they just want to sleep through life and experience as little as possible .
it is common for anyone in a busy lifestyle to let friendships slip . but when you are faced with your approaching death , the physical details of life fall away . people do want to get their financial affairs in order if possible . but it is not money or status that holds the true importance for them . they want to get things in order more for the benefit of those they love . usually though , they are too ill and weary to ever manage this task . it is all comes down to love and relationships in the end . that is all that remains in the final weeks , love and relationships .
we set up and take down each saturday morning . we have two shelves in the classroom that we clear of toys and set up the stories and art materials . here is a picture of our shelves . you can see we are purchasing and making material as we need them so the new testament shelves are bare . but not for long i was tempted to spread out the materials so we would n't have empty space . then i thought of the much used phrase , watch where i go and get this work so you will know just where to find it . i decided empty space was better than constantly shifting everything .
school spirit is very important to me . i want to be proud of where to go to college , and syracuse university is the perfect fit . the students there scream for their sports teams and they are a big , loving , orange community . i visited su during the spring reception and every student i talked to told me that choosing su was the best decision of their life . my favorite part of campus visits are the tours . i really want to be a tour guide when i get to college . that way , i will be able to show other people how much i love the school i am going to .
another interesting thing to note is how much more text heavy the older picture books were than ones published today . a friend who attended a children 's writing conference last weekend said the editor who spoke recommended no more than words for a picture book text . i wonder if the push for shorter and shorter texts for pretty much all picture books has contributed to the decline in their sales as the new york times noted recently , many parents are pushing their kids to listen to chapter books at earlier and earlier ages . maybe they would feel less need to do so if they had meaty complex picture books like these old ones available .
how i think this ties in with the notion of their being no mistakes , is that sometimes it is possible to use whatever happens in any moment as something useful and beautiful . i had a great time recently where in the middle of one of my songs i completely forgot the words . i stopped the song , held the silence in the air for a while , retried it , still could nt remember the lyrics , held my arm up in the air for silence , told everyone it would be worth the wait , then carried on with the song exactly at the point i d left it once i remembered the lyrics .
you know , there is nothing wrong with please and thank you in fact , i use each of them several times a day , and i actually mean it when i say them . i speak those words with joy and deep gratitude that comes from a knowledge that so many of the good things that happen in our lives are the result of the thoughtful actions of others , and in addition to paying forward these kindnesses , i also want to drop a nice appreciation , right there on the spot for everyone to see . but as cool and wonderful as please and thank you are , there is absolutely nothing magic about them .
i really enjoyed today 's meditation . it was back to basics , being aware and present in the moment , so important . and it lasted only a minute or two . and then setting your intention . i think this is always important , to actually set my intention , but in a busy life , sometimes it is the last thing i do , when it should be the first . maybe i will try starting each day with that , just setting my intention . i mean how can the universe provide if i , myself , do n't even know what it is i am looking for , in the most basic sense .
so why is this world so hung up on perfection maybe it 's just me , but i do n't want perfection , i want real . a real face , real hair , a real smile ... and yes , real breasts i 'll take a real pair of b 's over a fake set of d 's any day . and i 'll bet if you ask any man at least any man with more depth than a ' ken ' doll he 'll tell you the same thing . we do n't want perfection , we want real . we want to see a woman for who she really is and what she really looks like .
i originally took this video to document why i needed the new box . as i continued to watch it , i could not help but wonder what was going on . did the child really know that the bowl was not full or was he telling me that he was not done filling the bowl those are two very different operations , both of which are valid . if he was filling the bowl , then he did n't understand the concept or his understanding included the pile getting bigger as he added to the bowl . if he was not done filling the bowl , then he is wrapped up in the actions of scooping and pouring .
it felt so real . i want to go back there . i want to see more . i want to talk with her again , and see that place again . i can still feel her hand on my shoulder as we floated over the valley . i can still see her eyes as she spoke the words your mind is capable of so much more than you know . she always had this certain look about her whenever she was about to tell me something really important , and that was the look she had in the dream . what was she about to say what was she trying to tell me was it really just a dream
some things had just been taken as they were clearing out the boat . nothing was mentioned at the time , but i found out later a few of rob s linen shirts had been kept by my g f who had found rob , a few other things that i later thought about and asked about had just been taken too . sure made me wonder who my friends were . it s not in my nature to be like that , to just take without asking and most definitely not when helping someone out at a time of tragedy life lessens once again . it was nt the cost of the items , it was the principle .
another variation would be to race to pick up as many of one object as one can . if you are going only once down the board , this means that the person to roll the smaller number and have to take more turns is likely to gain more of the objects . on the other hand , if there is only one object on each square , then the slower person is likely to land on more empty squares where the pieces have already been taken . or perhaps objects are just on random squares and not every square awards the player with an object . then luck of the die is going to have more of an effect .
when i take pictures , i take lots of pictures . if they are sports pictures , or anything involving kids , i just keep shooting . i take lots of crap pictures , but sometimes in the middle of all the chaos is a good shot . but that means from a single hockey game i ll have upwards of photos . and i have to go through all of them and see where the good shots are and where the bad ones are . wonderful . i wish i could make everyone freeze while i find the best shot and mess with my camera to get the right look on the first try . but that does nt happen
that s when i decided to pull my feet up off the floor . well , i can tell you that i m not very comfortable at the moment . i ve had to change positions several times . from all of the times i ve been bit im keep thinking that another one is on me , so i have to take a look and then type a few more words . i think what is happening at this point is that the places were i ve been bit smart every once in a while creating the sensation that i m being bit again , when really it s just the poison from the bite that i m feeling .
though i wanted to cry , i did n't . this teacher had broken me of crying on the first day of school , when she threatened me a child who had just walked in the door and had not previously been away from my mother longer than an hour by saying she would send me to the principal 's office if i did n't stop crying , and that i would be in big trouble . i had learned that school was a scary , unsafe and mean place , and i learned that crying was only an annoying weakness in my teacher 's eyes . so i rarely cried in kindergarten , even though i frequently had reason to .
even if you re one of the people who tries to plan their future out like myself , you re going to hit one hell of a roadblock after those four years . sure , you might know what you want to do maybe you want to be a fashion designer , a teacher , or a writer but very rarely is figuring out how to get there that easy . unfortunately , that s where me and a shit ton of the people i graduated with are currently stuck . we all have one map with a big x at where we want to be , but we do nt have a clue the direction to head to get there .
is this whole thing worth it in the end is my fight really worth the struggle i do nt know if time will ever tell . i do know that as i refuse to grow up , relationships will change . do i want these to change i tweeted earlier about what it was like to now know how to handle a crying girl , which is something that i did nt know how to deal with for a long time . now , i can be the person i need to be . i only mention this because the relationship has changed , and i am the one who needs to be there for some people due to my perspective .
today i was stood up twice by people who wanted to meet with me to get help with their spiritual life . i saw both of them on facebook as i was waiting on them to show up . a couple that wanted help with their marriage was supposed to meet with me today , but they had something come up . sure , these can probably be explained , but it does make you wonder about our priorities . the bible says to seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and then all else will be added to it . somehow we think that we need to get everything else in order and then find time for god .
luckily i have a job that effects people in a positive way . and a singer who writes things who inspire people . i recognize that , and this is one of a few career choices that i find worth in . that does n't mean what people do is n't worthwhile , this is just my personal set of unfounded expectations for the world . you have to do what you have to do to get by , and a self righteous point of view does n't always fit into that . but if there is anything this little documentary taught me , is that we all can be doing something more . no matter what position you 're in .
i miss you when i m scared that i m not going to find anyone . i miss the woman who would say to me of course you will find someone . you are special , and you will find someone who will love you in the way that you deserve . i miss the woman who really believed that a love that was strong enough to overcome almost everything was possible . that woman did nt have hardly any role models to show her it was true , but she somehow believed she was going to be the exception . that he was going to be the exception the man who would nt let her down , no matter what .
but back to the baking . so i like baking because i can spend all day in the kitchen and focus on things that make sense a cup of sugar , cup of milk , pour into bowl rather than all the things that do n't make sense men , the education system , the future of my career . in addition to the calming aspect of baking , i like the fact that i can give away the things i make . it 's hard to cook well for one person , and i get tired of having to invite people over all the time . besides , who wants to come over every night just to eat my new things
i have had summer on the brain lately . i know it is only january but summer activities for kids book up quickly here does that happen everywhere else or is texas just crazy . i have been trying to figure out which ones are the most important to us , how much we can afford and if the schedules all fit together . first priority is definitely swim lessons for my daughter . man , those are super expensive i found a program that is highly recommended and is fairly affordable compared to others . i have called them twice and no one has returned my call . so frustrating hello i am trying to give you my business call me back
however . . . i came up with a brilliant plan to steal my sister in law 's photos from facebook . last weekend , almost my entire family came down and we had a fun weekend swimming at the hotel pool , eating and enjoying being together . i got to play host for a few meals too which i always enjoy . and no , i did n't have to break the bank to pay for the food i stayed under budget for the week , including our normal food plus the extra food for our weekend . i love not spending tons of money on groceries oh . . . and now i have to apologize for stealing pictures .
. women in la decided at some point to behave like men . they saw the only women engaging with men at all were women who adapted to the casual sex environment . the problem is , i do n't know a ton of women who actually respected that come and go behavior when men were the only ones doing it . it ca n't come as a shock that many men do n't either . oh , they still have sex with those girls , but now no one seems particularly fulfilled with the choice . do n't get me wrong a lot of people are having sex , but i just do n't see a lot of people who are happy .
in these examples , i may not be describing you and your relationship with your children . but i am describing real adults and their real relationships with their real children i mean , it happens , it really does . and the saddest part is that our children , these children , see their parents as the ultimate model , and teacher , and authority in their lives , and they can grow up with a sense that the parenting they experience every day is the way parenting is supposed to be . and so they come to expect such behavior in their own parents , and in other parents and so they stand a reasonable chance of becoming such parents themselves .
in a previous post i mentioned that i thought the author of loveisntenough.com is too liberal for my taste . i was trying to put a finger on the feeling i had , but was n't quite able to do it at the time . i think i have now . i think she focuses to much on her children 's race and makes it too much of an issue . that being said , sometimes you have to do so in order to get your point across and teach others . i believe she is trying to teach as many people as possible about what it is really like to grow up as a black person in america , among other things .
please note the word willing in my list of requirements . a man s effort is worth a lot . if he tries and fails it s up to you to decide how important that requirement is to you . i came up with this list after being honest about myself about what i am able to give to my partner . this list has helped me avoid huge wastes of my time . i will not work harder for someone than they are willing to work for me point , blank , period . sometimes writing down what you want need to be happy and secure in a relationship gives you the strength you need to walk away or work it out .
i am blessed i never realized how rich my life is . at , i m fairly healthy , i have many , many friends , two wonderful sons , family , and i am on the other side of the world . during these past few months , i have heard from so many people who are following my journey many friends and new followers are taking this voyage with me and so while there are days when i feel very alone , i know i can always log on to the internet and find friends who are with me in spirit for that , i am so thankful i recognize now how my words touch others and how their words touch me
i hear a loud thud . then crying . great , they really are trying to kill each other . i can tell from the crying that the injury is probably not life threatening . i do nt dare get up to check on them until this call is over . i would hate for the person on the other end to know that i have monsters in my house . they probably do nt have monsters in their house . i m pretty sure this is a freak thing that no other parent has ever experienced . no still , it s not exactly what you want to hear on the other end of a phone while you re trying to do business .
we never set out to adopt a five year old . that 's not really a secret . we wanted babies or at least little boys under the age of two . but we got a five year old and a three year old and truly , we got exactly the kids we were supposed to get . knowing that i 've already missed so much of your life breaks my heart . buying size and shoes for your feet , knowing that i missed all the other sizes before that , breaks my heart . they 're just shoes . you 'll wear them for a while , possibly pass them on to your brother eventually , they are n't a big deal .
for his gift , we got him a bike . i have been planning on this bike since right after christmas . seth loves to take the girls each weekend riding on their bikes , and so i knew that he would love to join them he even has mentioned to me a few times that he was going to use his birthday money from my parents to get him a bike but , i had him beat i think he loved it now he just has to use that birthday money to get a trailer to go behind the bike to haul all these girls around , and he will be set i just may have to ask for a bike myself this year
people get so offended to see fat women with confidence . fat women in dresses and bathing suits and any sort of clothing that draws attention colorful , short , tight , revealing and swim wear any type of clothing whose purpose is nt to hide their bodies from the rest of the world . why why are people so offended to see fat people being humans in public holding hands with their loved ones , kissing their loved ones , dancing at a club with their girls etc . lying on a beach or sitting on a bench . i ll tell you why . america has its own little value system when it comes to women . fat girls are on the bottom .
if you are just starting this phase , still in this phase , getting out of this phase , you got ta know it s totally normal and the most important , possible thing you can do is do a lot of work . do a huge volume of work . put yourself on a deadline so that every week or every month you know you will finish one story . you create the deadline . it s best if you have someone waiting for the work , even if it s somebody that does nt pay you . it is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap , and your work will be as good as your ambitions .
now , this may sound just a little odd however you have to take into consideration who you need to meet and date or start a friendship with . in case you are simply searching for real love , then that may are available any shape or type nevertheless , if you are in search of a sure type of one who is the same religion or leads a certain life style it s essential to think about this . it might not all the time be so vital to everybody but typically will probably be and you need to give lots of thought to this because some people will be searching for a certain type of individual so take into consideration first just in case .
the next problem is that the hearts are top heavy . this makes is more difficult to dip into the chocolate . when i started to dip , i could feel the pop was not very secure on the stick . through trial and error , i was finally able to dip and keep the hearts on the stick . i 'm trying to figure out a way to describe it , but i think you have to feel out while doing it . just go slowly , take your time . once the heart is covered in chocolate and sets until the chocolate is hardened , it will be very secure on the stick and you can proceed normally without worry it will fall off .
in my classroom we have a behavior board . it s a rainbow and each day all the children start on green . if they make good choices all day they might be moved up to blue , or if they are an absolute angel , they move to purple . however , if they do nt listen and make some not so good choices , they might have to move to yellow , orange , or red . chances are if you get to red , i m also sending you to the office and you re in major trouble . one day little susie comes up to me and says , i did nt punch anyone in the head . can i move to blue
peter called me from his car on his way home to thank me once again for a very interesting evening . i said interesting is that what you call it he laughed and said it really was and that it was finally nice to put faces to those he d heard about and assured me it was nt uncomfortable for him at all . i asked him why did he think they d all decided before ever meeting him that they did nt like him he said they were jealous , that he and i had become friends without them being involved and that i respected his professional opinion and was life coaching with him . i said jealous of me that just ca nt be .
happy new year to everyone . i used to think september was a time for renewal . it is my birthday month , i would be starting a new year at school , i love fall . all these things would encourage me to want a new start . now that i am older i feel like this time of year is good for a fresh start . i plan to reflect on the past year and maybe make some changes , or resolutions . i will realize i did quite a bit and things really are going well . i will also , because i am me , come up with quite a few things i am not happy with and work to change them .
so , yes , here we are in canada . we arrived in toronto on thursday and since then we have been trying to get used to the time difference , trying to sleep , trying to wake up and generally just being confused and a little delirious . we are staying with relatives just outside the city for now and so we have been meeting up with various family members over the past few days . we 've had dinner with the oldest uncle and got to know the newest cousin only months of age . h has been enjoying being the big grown up one for a change i ca n't quite believe that the big hand on this picture belongs to our little girl
all in all , i think that this move by democrats will hurt them in the long run . not so much because weiner was such a rising star in the party although he was but more because it shows that the leadership in the democratic party has no interest in supporting their members , and instead will do whatever it takes to get things done , instead of leading their party and trying to get members to step in line like the republicans do why do you think we could n't pass real , comprehensive health reform it was n't the republicans that were holding the bag , they were just saying ' no ' whenever they had the opportunity , but mostly they were ignored .
when i went to my sister 's house for thanksgiving i saw that she had picked up crochet again . i had been rolling this around in my mind too , and i had actually packed yarn and a hook for the drive hours but discovered that i get car sick if i focus too closely on detail work or reading . sigh . lucky that the library has books for download as this makes the time fly . the lost hero by rick riordan was entertaining for everyone . anyway , seeing that my sister was back in crochet mode was all i needed to get myself going again . she gave me an awesome book that has stitches in it that i 'll share another day .
with each sketch there will also be a ' challenge ' posted . you may complete two layouts for each sketch this time your choice , one with the sketch , and then one with the challenge but if you use both of them for each time you must turn , flip , or mirror the sketch for example , if you use the sketch and the challenge on one layout then want to complete it again , you must turn , flip or mirror it for a second one , even if you are just doing the sketch on the second one . if you are solely doing the ' challenge ' part then you do n't have to , you will just need to complete the challenge
i just love watching movies . i love watching movies with friends , with women , with dates do i date with family , and with myself . today my brother jimmy said , i think for nate , there are two categories that movies fall under . movies he does n't like , and his favorite movies . he said this because i said to my parents that red might now be one of my favorite action comedy movies but it 's true . i do love movies . many movies become my favorite movies . there are movies i do n't like , and there are many , but i still watch movies , because there are so many good , happy , awesome ones out there
i get most emails regarding this topic , and as i have said before i am not sure what you should prepare for , i ca n't tell you how to do it , and i am not an expert on it . what i can do is share articles from folks who have specific ideas or suggestions and you may find interesting or helpful . i think we are in for some very troubled times , and me and mine are doing what we can to be prepared for difficulties . read and decide for yourself if it is worth doing , the what to do , and how to do it . i make no claims nor suggestions , just provide the information i found interesting to you .
i was definitely being prepared for what was to come . my scripture study and also my other fun reading were all about how we will go through hard times and it is our choice as to how we handle it and the attitude we have . also , this is part of something joseph fielding smith said he god knew not only what each of us could do , but also what each of us would do when put to the test and when responsibility was given us . i just knew that something was coming and i was going to have to show that i would do it . i hope that the way i handle the up and the down will be my way of showing i can
this is not a telephone or internet session . all you do is just relax and sit or lie down during the session and pay attention to what is happening in your body . because there will be many people in the session , i please ask that you do n't email or call to join . i would n't be able to handle all the email unless it is done this way . you join simply by using your intention after reading this email . also because this will be a big group i wo n't be able to answer questions before the session and i 'll give the details you will need in this email . please feel free to email me your experiences after the session is over .
i actually wrote a whole page on how this makes me feel . not going to bore you with that and really i do nt have the time , but this makes me furious . not that she says dad needs help , he does and toast is actually out there doing what she asked as we speak , but its the assumption that he does nt have anything else to do which is not at all true , i ca nt fucking breathe because there is not enough time to get everything done , and that even if he does , he needs to do what she said because its more important . i mean seriously , can she not ask for help , does she always have to demand things
a memory from my childhood popped into my racing thoughts . it was a bizarre memory to be emerging at this moment a memory of a vision i had at my grandma s house when i was a boy . my cousins came over to play with my brothers and me . everyone ran inside to get a drink . as i lingered behind and found myself alone in the large yard , my eye caught something in the sky . i looked up and saw something incredible and golden up above portland s west hills . i could not tell if it was real or just my imagination playing games with me . it was also easter weekend , which made everything seem even stranger . . . or maybe stronger
that made me suffer like this . it is not fair for me , you know that i am on the top too . you know that i am not just a woman . stand by out there anywhere but why instead of them who truly shows that they 're care for me why i just have only attention on you . my focus my attention my time really no cared to anybody but why why you 're so cold so cruel i am sad so terrible in pain . still i need you , even though still i like you still i want you , still i care for you and still i love you . love is blind my love you teach me that that 's what i am now
in a way , it 's both good news and bad news that the author now has such a large part to play in the process . bad because promotion takes very different skills to writing and also because it takes time and energy away from the actual process of writing good because it does enable writers to have some control over the content and methods by which they are publicised . i remember when my books were first published , i was warned not to do anything at all , but to leave all the publicity to the ' experts ' . but the truth is that no one is going to give your books and indeed your career the same amount of focus and attention that you can bring yourself .
when our son turned one , he was crawling very fast , and pulling himself up to stand . so i thought it would only be a matter of days or weeks before he was running around on two feet . i was looking forward to this because he was getting very heavy for me to be carrying and holding whenever the ground was n't ideal for crawling . when a couple of months went by and he was n't walking yet , i thought maybe he needed some encouragement . i would stand him up next to a push toy , or hold my arms out just beyond his reach when he was standing up holding onto something . but it quickly became very clear that he just was n't ready yet .
two of our long time friends surprised us with a visit on thursday . they both have moved away to a place that 's helping them get back on their feet . i felt like it was christmas , seeing them again . they shared with us how well things are going for them . they looked healthy , and they have life back in their eyes again . they also shared how much mission of hope and our staff means to them . one of them said , this mission of hope is where it all started for me . we snapped a picture of all of us together before they left . i 'm still thanking god today for their visit last week . he used it to encourage my soul .
let him know your long term goals , so that he knows why you ca nt spend on unnecessary things . for example you could say , i would like to have saved by the end of the year , so that i can go back to school . that s why i ca nt spend on a concert ticket . it would be a good idea to do inexpensive things for him to show you care . you could bake him his favorite cookie , set up a room with candles , soft music , give him a massage , or cook him dinner . the most important thing is to let him know that regardless of what you do , you love to be with him and that you care about him .
i think very few teachers will admit they are nt , but look at it this way , if we know , we do nt want to admit it but we know , that it s impossible for every person to have a creative job just because there are nt creative jobs for everyone , so if we know that and we are increasingly producing lessons to stimulate the creative mind let s say because we think this is a preparation for the adult life and that it inevitably consists of some kind of job , so they need to be creative , are nt we forgetting about the other half of the population who wo nt have , or do nt want , creative jobs and in fact need other things in order to succeed
he is going to his friend s son s soccer game at why do they schedule these things when the sun is the highest and then on to see another friend at the hospital where the friend had a baby yesterday . he asked if i wanted to go along to see the new baby , but my hair and make up are nt done . he always does this to me asks me at the last moment when i am not made up . and then i have to rush to get ready to see people i do nt want to see because they make me self conscious . and worst yet , i am at my mother s house when he asked , so how in the heck am i expected to do my hair
they leave next tuesday and this mother and dad are excited and have heavy hearts at the same time . i know lindsey 's parents are feeling the same as tony and i are . their house is empty everything is in storage imagine all those new wedding gifts , and they are so anxious to leave . they are packed and ready to go . i know they 'll miss all their family back home , but this is something they 've both wanted to do for a long time . and it 's an awesome time in their young lives to go we would n't feel near as comfortable with their decision if they did n't already have some good christian people over there to welcome them and help them to get on their feet
i lost my grandma last year on july th . i was with her until her very last breath . sitting by her bed at the hospital listening to the machines beat slower and slower , watching her blood pressure and heart rate dropping lower and lowrr was the hardest thing i have ever done . i cried . a lot . i feel fortunate that i was able to see her and say goodbye before she passed away but i really wish she was still here . i am grateful for the time i was able to spend with her and i have many fond memories of her , i just wish she was here to see my wedding and hold my future children . she was a wonderful woman with a heart of gold .
now if you do nt want to come off that way , just find better ways to word it if you ca nt talk . everyone is busy and if someone reaches out to you , even though they are probably busy too , then you can give them the curiosity of being nice to them . here s the main deal , being busy is great and for the most part all of us , so no one gives any thought about that in a real conversation , unless they ask you how busy you are do nt response with you telling them how busy you are . lets be honest , that s just rude , so think on that before you response with i am busy no one cares if you are or not .
dad s been struggling with his walking for quite some time , but he managed to walk to where the caravan once was , across the old playing field , past where the shower block once stood and we all looked at where the caravan used to stand . you could still see the pitch , the garden now very different to how it used to look , but i could see it how it used to be . we stood for a while and then walked back to collect the car at the entrance . i know dad struggled with the last bit of that walk , but i was so pleased he managed to see all of that . i was proud to be able to walk with him along the journey of the past .
usually i m pretty good about just avoiding things like fries and chips . if they re in front of me or in my house , they will be eaten . so i do nt buy them or order them . for whatever reason , it was really hard to say no this time . it was one of those situations where i had to get anthony to say no for me , because i was nt strong enough . i felt pretty ashamed , and still do . i hate that feeling that food has this power over me . i mentioned this to him , and he was quick to remind me that it had only been a month and change would come . but sometimes , i really doubt it . i doubt myself .
so far , i have a few cards in five out of the six spx sets listed above . the first set i started building was the ' spx pro motion basketball set . in my humble opinion , it 's highlighted by one of the best looking michael jordan cards in the hobby click here . ironically , that 's the only card i need to complete that five card set . even without the jordan , i 'm pretty excited to be done with the set . unfortunately , i 'm not as far with the other five sets . i have a few cards in each set and am slowly building each set . i would like to complete two out of the six sets this year as they are my highest collecting priority .
but now i am going to him who sent me . none of you asks me , where are you going rather , you are filled with grief because i have said these things . but very truly i tell you , it is for your good that i am going away . unless i go away , the advocate will not come to you but if i go , i will send him to you . when he comes , he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin and righteousness and judgment about sin , because people do not believe in me about righteousness , because i am going to the father , where you can see me no longer and about judgment , because the prince of this world now stands condemned .
since she was fairly comfy i decided to head over to the office to see a few patients . i knew the patient would have the nurse call me when she needed me to be with her . about two hours later she was ready for me . the nurse had said that she did n't want to do anything like the tub or the birth ball . she was very opposed to moving , which was fine i just sat with her . finally , she seemed to be losing focus , crying instead . she asked me for something for the pain . i told her , let 's check your cervix , if you are close then you just keep doing what you are doing . if not , then we 'll discuss the options .
i would always just stand on the players side and perform trick shots for hours from five to ten feet back where the player would usually stand , just to try and increase the difficulty , i still made at least of my shots . it was a good run though , sometimes i told the players that if they could match one of my shots out of that i would them double the prizes of the shots that i got in . all the prize was were some goldfish , no one just wants one . if they could match three then i would throw in a little tank for free . no one ever got the tank , and i do n't think many got the extra fish either , it still had them paying though .
oh , the woman with the two small kids called me yesterday to wish me a happy easter . she got a hold of a relative that lives in another part of the country and she is going to live with them , at least for a while . i am happy for her and her kids . she feels bad taking them out of their school in the middle of the year , but it has to be better than living in a shelter . she is taking the bus in the next few days after she gets the money he sent her to get the tickets . she sounded much calmer when i talked to her yesterday . i am glad that i was able to help her while she was figuring out what to do next .
the present debate is on whether to keep it secret like other countries are doing or in custom of a total see through society come out and tell the truth . india is so loose and democratic it is very hard to keep a secret for long . the major anxiety of the government today is that unlike other countries , it will be very difficult to keep it secret much longer . if the information comes out through unauthorized channels first and then the authorities are pressed against the wall to confess , two bad things can happen . first , it can actually cause a panic in the country as well as the world . second , the way the indian politics is run , the ruling party will be thrown out of power in no time .
so for those of you who did not catch the title of yesterday 's and today 's post , i will tell you that it is a line from the song the rain , the park , and other things , you can hear the song here . when i was thinking about my floral series for the weekend , i could n't help but sing the song aloud . it is somewhat meaningful to me because my mom loves it so much . she was just recently married to her first love they dated in high school but did n't find each other again until about three years ago , and this was a song that was special to them . apparently , my step dad called my mom his ' flower girl . hence the title of my series .
why is it that just when things seem to be going well , someone has to turn things around and cause trouble in this case it is someone who used to be a friend . it hurts because she seems to think it 's okay to involve my daughter in everything . the first thing she does is run to ashton and say did you know your mom said this what does it concern ashton i want her to stay away from my daughter she says i 'm a bad mom because i do n't want my daughter to be around drugs . i wish people would take a look at their own lives before making comments about other people . take a look at your own kids before you judge you do not know everything they are doing you just do n't
i know that we will get pregnant and i know that the baby will come when he she feels like it , if you re listening , we are ready i also know that when it does happen we will look back and be so grateful that it happened when it did . i have all the confidence in the world in heavenly father and i know that he knows what i need more than i know , so i am just putting all my trust in him and will be so thankful when the time comes . i have also realized that i am glad that it has been harder than getting pregnant right away , even though it has been really hard , because i will be so grateful when i am pregnant , even if i am horribly sick .
once upon a time , a man named fred rogers decided that he wanted to live in heaven . heaven is the place where good people go when they die , but this man , fred rogers , did nt want to go to heaven he wanted to live in heaven , here , now , in this world , and so one day , when he was talking about all the people he had loved in this life , he looked at me and said , the connections we make in the course of a life maybe that s what heaven is , tom . we make so many connections here on earth . look at us ive just met you , but i m invested in who you are and who you will be , and i ca nt help it .
i 've know my friend for years now and met nearly everyone in her family with the exception of her youngest brother . when i came back to tennessee to start the caregiver position for them i met him . it was a brief encounter and he was leaving to go back home in a few days so i never got to know him well , until january , when he came back for weeks to do some work . after leaving we have spoken almost daily to share what his dad is doing and how well . while he was here he noticed i was having trouble with my laptop and he offered to have it fixed if i decided i wanted to . i told him no , i was willing to put up with it and we left it at that .
i really started to think of what the kid was doing in the drawing , what he was feeling and why . it no longer was about how the character looked . i am currently in the process of adding more details to the drawing that will develop the story behind the drawing . this time i am not screen recording my process because i feel that when i do , i rush myself . so not screen recording this time around allows me concentrate on the drawing instead having to worry about the time . for this drawing i have nt decided if its going to have a dark feeling to it or maybe something completely different . if i do end up going to the darker side of the drawing , i am going to have to darker the clothes i already started to paint in .
with all these different colors , god makes a painting with all these notes and noises , god forms a chorus . all the churches of the world , in particular their members , those who follow jesus and give themselves to him , are all part of the same effort and the same result making the truth and glory of god known , no matter what else may be happening around them . what one member and one church ca nt do , another can . what one member and one church does well , another struggles . but together they make the church , the body of christ , and together we show the world who jesus is , what a wonderful work he s done , what he s about , and what it is to know his grace and truth , his power and beauty .
my official starting weight for this week exercise challenge is lbs . that 's higher than my friday weigh in of . lbs , but that 's what the scale said sunday , so that 's going to be my official starting weight . my goal has always been to lose lb per week . if i manage to do that , then i 'll be at lbs at the end of this challenge . given that my weight loss has been much slower over the last months , i doubt i 'll make the full lbs . my hope is to lose lbs every weeks , which would equal lbs lost over the challenge . that would put me at lbs , only lbs away my initial goal of lbs lost . if i 'm really lucky , i might even hit my goal by the time this challenge ends
john jesus therefore said to them , truly , truly , i say to you , unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood , you have no life in yourselves . he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life , and i will raise him up on the last day . for my flesh is true food , and my blood is true drink . he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me , and i in him . as the living father sent me , and i live because of the father , so he who eats me , he also shall live because of me . this is the bread which came down out of heaven not as the fathers ate , and died , he who eats this bread shall live forever .
in his message he expressed regret for not being there for me when i was growing up . the fact that he felt the need to apologize for something so thoroughly out of his control pulled on my heart strings and brought me to tears . he could have fought to be in my life if he had had any money to speak of and if he had been a legal citizen at the time . as it was , he was in no position to do anything about it , and i believe my mother had the right to want to move on with her life as well . i have zero blame to lay at the feet of either of my parents . it would n't be fair . everyone deserves a chance to move beyond the past and apologies are wholly unnecessary . what matters is what happens now .
i know they were , though . i do nt really know how to explain it , but they fell in between human and well , not so human . i saw them when i was little , all the time . they were just like real people , except there was just a little bit of something different about them . i d say they had wings , but that would just make me sound silly , would nt it i think they might have , but they were real hard to see , like my eyes could nt quite process them yet . my other uncle , michael , looked like one of them , but my mama did nt like it when i talked about them , so i do nt really think she knew . i guess that s why she left me with my aunt and my uncle .
today was an absolutely glorious day so to take advantage of the degree weather we decided to go to the zoo after church and after the girls ' nap . i have been planning on going to the zoo with the girls for a very long time , let 's just say that the girls had their zoo outfits before they were ever born what can i say anyways , i 'm pretty sure everyone else in san antonio had the same idea because it was crazy busy at the zoo . we got really lucky with a parking spot almost immediately and did n't have to stand in line for very long . they girls did great they only cried out a few times , but i think they were either eager to get out and walk or they wanted a snack . well enough of me talking , here are the pictures
once the situation was under control , i went to talk to my oldest and we talked about strength and how he was bigger and stronger than his little brother . we talked about injuries and how he could do long term damage to someone doing what he did . then i gave him the consequences that were going to come down because of his actions . he was mad and did n't want to do what i was telling him he had to do but i had to stick to my guns and make him follow through with the punishment . i can only hope and pray that the consequences were enough for him to understand that he can not do that any more . but what do we do in the moment when our kids do the stupidest thing we have ever seen how do we handle it and what do we say
i was happy that solsara was back with their eye gazing workshops , and some really interesting stuff came out of that there was a segment where you went to different partners , and whoever spoke up first told the other person something they saw in them . this one guy talked to me about how i was like a book that so many people have written in , but there are always more and more empty pages . i am still thinking about that and what it might mean then i had this intense reaction to this one woman i said had deep wisdom , but i just started totally crying when i was with her . it was a trip . i got to talk to her a bit later on in the weekend , but not as much as i would have liked . i hope she is there again next year
i believe that the goal should change from making children happy and protecting them from harm to raising them to be independent adults able to problem solve and cope in the real and sometimes difficult adult world . a safety net can become a trap . dependence on one s parents means lack of real security and often results in low self esteem , depression and anxiety . it 's nonsense . someone has written another book about how kids these days never grow up , and how it 's all the parents ' fault for being too helpful , too involved , too available . read more about it here . apparently , parents need to set more boundaries , have higher expectations , force independence at a younger age . the goal of parenting should be independence instead of happiness dependence leads to low self esteem security makes us feel insecure i disagree .
we 've had a couple of sunny days this weekend , which means i just had to go for a walk . with camera and cats . these photos are from last friday . already when i got up high enough to spot a glimpse of the sea , i could see it was a beautiful medium to dark blue . a shade that made it in lack of better words visible . many times you ca n't see a definite line between sea and sky before you get a clear view . not so so this time because this was a strong , but at the same time subtle and calm , blue shade . one of those shades that are pretty hard to capture with a camera without the rest of the landscape going a dark or weird tone . in other words , bluer than it might appear in my amateur photos .
but you wo n't see pictures of him walking in the door exhausted after a day at work or getting up at am to fly interstate for the week . he works so hard for this family just like so many families are working hard these days . and you do n't see pictures of me on my hands and knees washing bathroom floors or taking out the rubbish or hanging out laundry or doing the school run with a big pregnant belly and a baby on the hip and a little tribe following me . in some ways i am very average doing the regular stay at home mum thing and all the same jobs you do day in and day out . just like all families we have bills to pay , financial worries and priorities . do n't judge me by a fancy kitchen renovation . i 'm much more than that .
everything is acceptable , no matter what it is . as much as i am in favor of religious freedom , i always get angry when i happen on this sentence again . on one side it s nice you can do whatever seems right for you , even if it looks wrong to you . but try getting more exact response and you do nt know if just laugh or cry . we are like neutered to have an opinion or accept history as factual evidence . i often see this in writing communities too do whatever you want . how is that helpful to anyone we do nt learn from it , we re left to sink in that mud hole others call street , but crossing it is even harder because others wo nt help us to the house we need to go and all this together we ll be late for our appointment .
i 'm enjoying writing this novel . as with the last one , i find if i only have a few minutes , i can still add a bit to it . i leave my laptop switched on , and the document open but saved so it takes no time to get going again . with short stories , i need to have the whole story worked out in my head before i start to write , and i need a good couple of hours to get a complete first draft written . so unless i have a completely free evening , or half day at the weekend , i wo n't start a short story . when writing a novel , however , as i can pick it up more quickly , i 'm happy to add just a couple of hundred words while the dinner 's cooking , or before heading off to zumba class .
every man s idea of a real woman is going to vary based on their own character and life experiences . their perception of this type of woman will always be based on the fact that her self image is the same or higher than his . the truth of the matter though , is that real women are waiting on men of all levels to rise to the occasion and take a chance . how do i know this because i ve been there more than once . there have been numerous times when quality girls have shown interest in me and my self image would nt allow me to pursue them . it was nt until i started understanding myself and starting on a quest to become a real man who i was able to pursue my wife , and even then i had some issues to resolve from within before i could consider making her my wife .
looking back , i guess maybe we should have seen it coming , but when you re eleven years old , you do nt really expect it . i think dave knew , suspected at least . he and dad seemed to get into more and more fights , mostly about how we needed him there , how it was nt dave s job to run the family , it was his . i do nt know if the fights helped or hurt . all i do i know is that one day , dad packed three suitcases into the back of his beat up old subaru , told dave to take care of things while he was gone , then looked at me with a strange expression , ran his fingers through my hair , and with a kind of sad little smile said , try not to forget what i look like . i thought he was kidding around .
and , in case you were wondering about general process stuff , and where things fit in a year and ten month process like mine , they chose a cover artist i 'm not going to tell you who it is , because things can always go wrong , and there 's always a small possibility that they 'll have to change artists part way in . but i will say that all the members of the cover team , as well as marketing and sales , all were unanimous in their choice . which almost never happens . you know , not having control over your cover is a scary thing . when my editor sent me his name and links , i ca n't tell you how relieved i was i screamed , cried tears of joy and relief , and danced all at the same time . i have no doubt that whatever he does will be genius .
our restaurant expenses seemed surprisingly low to me . i feel like we do spend a lot of time eating out or getting take out b c we are so busy . so i guess i was expecting the worst in this category . we are buying for five well four , charlotte does n't consume quite what the rest of us do so a dinner out never costs us less than even though we try hard to keep the cost down no appetizer , have the girls share a dinner if we know the portion will be large , no alcohol , etc . . again , i feel like this total can be lower and planning our weekly meals will help us accomplish this . no more , crap what the hell am i going to make tonight we need to leave for karate in an hour . so even if we trim this figure by , i 'll be excited and call it a success .
so for the rest of the week we stayed at the hospital . you met your big brother , we worked on nursing , mommy worked on healing and we just spent our days and nights feeding you , loving you and learning how to be your mommy and daddy . you passed lots of tests like car seat challenges , hearing tests , temperature tests , weight checks and all of that . you passed them all on friday morning we learned that everybody was looking good and we had been released to go home . we happily packed up all of our stuff and checked out . as we were leaving the hospital with our cart load of gifts , flowers , stuff , two car seats loaded with babies i still did not believe it . i could not believe you were really coming home with me . we said thank you and goodbye to all of our wonderful nurses and made our way home .
in the end , i guess i did not really agree to medicine . i chose it over and above my desire to be , well , everything else , as well as my desire to be with my family , to be home , to travel the world , and , most importantly , to earn my own living . it s killing me to have to depend on other people for finances , haha . medicine allows me to understand even if i can not do anything about it , to do something about it even if i know i m going to fail , to fail as long as i tried anyway but still understanding where i went wrong so i do nt make the same mistake again . so , during the times i get frustrated with it , this is what i tell myself , repeatedly i chose this over and above everything else so , honey , kindly do nt screw it up .
and you ca n't do it alone . for me , it took god , my parents , professionals , a therapist , and some important friends . i was the one doing the hard work . but if i tried to do it by myself , i would have failed over and over again . god held me in the most difficult times of my healing . whenever i thought i felt the most afraid , the most alone , i would pray and open myself up to his love and grace and realize that he was with me not only at that moment but also when things were happening in my childhood and that he cried with me . i had my parents by my side paying my hospital bills , coming to family therapy , hearing what i was willing to stop protecting them from . i had friends and teachers who sent me cards , talked to me on the phone to keep my spirits up , came to visit .
i ca nt say it was all bad though . losing all my friends caused me to start my career at an early age . in many ways i ve risen above what people thought of me . in many ways i just started to live the life everyone thought i had . it s been a wild ride . there are so many things i would change . i say that now , but i m sure if you ask me again in a few years the answer would be different . it s time to stop living in fear and start using all this as motivation to be who i was before i let these things get to me . the person who worked hard and excelled at what she loved . maybe now i can finally put all this behind me and go back to being me . a new me . now that i ve found out exactly when i became lost i can remember who i was before all that and be her again .
at my old job , the people in my department were like family . i would share anything and everything with them , on a weekly or daily basis . i knew i could talk to them about the exciting stuff , the hard stuff , the silly stuff . and i thoroughly enjoyed their company except when i was tired or grumpy and did n't want to talk to other humans . if i did n't have any work to do for the day , i still got paid . it did n't matter that i was really only writing for hours a day i was getting paid for the entire day . and i had amazing benefits and a good retirement plan . i knew the client inside and out and felt comfortable voicing my opinion and asking questions when i did n't understand the reasoning behind something . i felt very safe every day at work well , except for maybe that one day my wallet got stolen off my desk , but every other day was cool .
then comes the story i m working on now . i originally thought it was an action adventure story set in the future . some of the action scenes are glorious but there was something about the story that i could nt quite figure out , so i just put it aside . about a year later i had read a novel by ashley fontainne and i realized that it was her style of writing that the story needed . she had done a book giveaway for me and worked pretty damn hard to help me promote my book that weekend . i also had the opportunity to see just how much of herself she put into promoting her own work . afterwards i wanted to thank her for what she had done for me and had no real idea as to how i would do that . the only thing i could think of was to ask her if she would want anything to do with the story idea that i had . i was really surprised when she accepted my offer .
we went to two different stores , and i ended up with such a headache . my daughter wanted me to buy her all kinds of things . towards the end , she was fixated on me buying her an easter basket and treats for her classroom . i was planning on getting those things today , when she was at school . i told her this . she did nt want to wait . i ended up very frustrated from constantly saying no , and telling her i will take of those things the next day . i ended up with a really bad headache . i just wanted to go home . i was disappointed , because i had started off enjoying myself . i really just wanted to look around in the group of stores we were at . they had a lot of things that the stores in my town do nt have . i could tell my husband was not happy . there were a couple of stores he wanted to check out . but , he understood .
but the interview is not what s on my mind right now . last night i talked to my ex boyfriend on the phone . we were practically married and together for about five years . it has been a little over a year since we broke up but we have maintained contact and are trying to stay friends . this , of course , brings complications . i sometimes wish we had one of those overly dramatic break ups that leaves you immobilized for a couple weeks but over time you forget all about the person and move on with your life . we chose the other path , though . the one where one day you think things are great and that you have moved on and oh , is nt it great that we can still be best friends then the next day you hear that he s been dating a ton of people and you have too , to be fair but you suddenly realize that you re not over him . well , this has been my last year .
what have you people been doing since september i barely know what i 'm doing but apparently i am doing a better job than most of them with my limited knowledge and skills . i 'm not even saying that i do n't have my own problems . hell i think i having more problems then the other teams . i break my own security measures at least once a week minimum . i 'm planning on making a huge series of y u no 's by the end of this . i 'm not even trying to say that i am better than them . i know that i am an idiot , it 's just who i am . half the time i ca n't even explain what i am actually doing , i just know how to do it in my own backwards way . of course i do at least make sure to comment the flip out of everything programmers will understand . the only thing i can say i am is what the team leader told me i was driven .
can you just say , hey god , i am worried about this and i need your help , and then just start worrying about it all over again . of course not . i do it all the time . i have to stop . i have to understand what jesus was saying in matt . . in verse it says , and indeed your heavenly father knows that you need all these things . god knows before you ask . he still wants you to ask and communicate with him as this establishes a relationship in which you will hear him speaking to you more clearly , but he already knows what you need . do nt whatever this worry thing . it is a big deal . you really can believe in god . he will get you through any situation . now , does that always mean it works out how we have planned . no , but that is because these are not our plans , they are god s , and i think he knows better than you and i.
oh how we all want more . however , sometimes what we really want is less . i know many of the things i have wanted lately are less of . i want less pain . i want less cold . i want less of a cold . i want less mean and nasty people . i want less bad food . sorry , i can see that in wanting less i am blocking more . because i do nt really want those things at all . i want my body to feel more pleasure . i want to feel more warmth . i want to be able to breathe more , and better . i want more nice people . and i so want more good food . yeah , i really did title this right . i want to be getting more . i realized in typing this that i am not a selfish person . on the contrary as i ask for more of what i really want that i am increasing the good and as anything good increases it gets bigger and better .
the first day he came to school with me , it took forever for him to walk from the car into the center . and not because he had just started walking a few weeks earlier and was still a bit unsteady on his feet . he stopped for every new sound , movement or sight that caught his attention . a car drove past and he stopped to just stare at it . once he was certain it was gone , he turned back to me and continued on until a college student approached so he stopped to watch him pass by as well . a bird tweeted and he stopped , looking around to see if he could find it . it was so hard not to rush him but , i gave him the time and space to take it all in . a month later , he still stops frequently to look around but it does n't take us quite as long to get inside , provided he does n't decide to test his limits and try to go in the opposite direction .
i had some help from katie when time away from school permitted . i really want my girl 's to know how to do these things it can really come in handy and it tastes so good to . i will miss her when she goes to college next year even though she will live at home just know she will be away makes me start to miss her presence at home already .. i still miss my oldest and i see her ever day . well she studies most of this time but i know she is here . i love my family very much . families change sort of like the seasons . the seasons change , the leaves fall and the grass dies , we are reminded by this verse how short our lives are . so enjoy all the time you have with your loved ones with love and laughter and always keeping god first in your heart and life makes life so much easier . until my next post i hope everyone is well and happy . thanks for coming by and god bless .
but anyway , the run to read fun run was designed to raise funds in order to build and restore libraries for the less fortunate communities here in the philippines . you see , there are only a few public libraries here from what i read , there s less than a thousand . when in fact , given our population and number of communities , there should be at least libraries to cater our people s needs . to some , libraries may not be as important . some might even think we do nt really need it . but for children this is a big and very important part of their growth . they can learn so much more from opening a book than watching the television . they can invest much more from studying what they read rather than begging on the streets . so if you want to be part of this change , what are you waiting for register now and join us categories are km , km , km and km . there will also be a m dash for kids and parents .
last week john and i went hiking , this time i check that i have my battery and card inside of my camera . we walked and walked until we were at our destination and could not go further . john even climbed to the highest peak in which i did not . i was afraid if i climb any higher i would be living at that point because getting back down was so hilly and narrow . the highest point i made it too that many of us chickens stop and took a photo then went back down the hill . if it was up too me i would of stop just half way as plan . i have a photo of me holding onto john tightly with a scary look on my face because the area was very narrow and too many people was at the one spot just waiting to also take photos . both john and i were so proud of ourselves of how long we hiked and how far high we went . it so reminded us of when we lived in the state .
it seems that this year i have really come into my own . i have truly stood up for myself and the things that i believe in and as a result have once again let people go from my life or have improved relationships with others . does n't that seem odd as a year old mom of i am just now coming into my own i have finally had the courage to speak publicly about my sister . i think my biggest fear dates back to years ago when my parents and i went to a compassionate friends convention and i was asked to read a poem i had written for my sister to everyone at the convention . i pretty much cried thru the entire poem . my emotions were very raw as it had only been years since meg had died . my fear with speaking was that i did not want people to see a weak side of me . but , i have realized that is what makes my experience so real and maybe something that some people ca n't handle or do n't want to be a part of .
i know when i first started trying to be extra nice to him make him feel as special as he really is , i did n't think frank noticed he never said anything , he did n't act differently . after greeting him at the door when he arrived home from work everyday with a kiss for several weeks , i slipped and was pre occupied with something and did n't kiss him right away . yes , i try to drop everything and kiss him before he either gets in the door or before he has a chance to close the door behind him but , i 'm not perfect and i mess up every now and then . he noticed that he asked if i was o.k . , was there anything wrong , and all sorts of questions before i caught on to what he really was trying to ask ' why did n't i get my routine welcome home kiss today ' . do n't give up ladies , if you think he does n't notice he probably does and just is n't saying anything or does n't know what to say .
i am happy to say that i found that in an incredible man . for privacy reasons , i will refer to him as mr. m. he has already shown me and my kids such love and support that i am blown away . he saw some pictures that i took of genesis ' th birthday this last march and how i took her flowers and such , and he told me he wished that he had known me then so that he could come with me and show his support . he said he would have brought her flowers as well . he lets me talk about her all i want without judgement and one time while talking to her he even broke down and cried . this is a huge deal as he does n't cry easily , even when his ex father in law who he was very close to passed away . he was even surprised by it . he has a really good heart . we talk a lot about the future and said he would consider it an honor if he could join me in remembering genesis on her birthday every year and any other time during the year that i wanted .
if i set my mind to something , i have to finish it . i 've been like that since i was a little kid . getting into programs in school , getting into my choice college , getting a job in the career i wanted . it was never a question of if this is going to happen . i knew it would if i worked at it . so i approached my next big challenge with weight loss in the same mindset . i had just started my job right out of school and i knew if i did n't change my habits now , it would be much harder later . new routine i had to get used to , new city , more money to buy healthy food and such . it was the ideal time to go for it . and i did . it was pretty awesome that the weight came off without too much difficulty . it also helped that i did n't have much of a social life in dc yet , so i could focus and not eat out in restaurants too much . after about months of successfully losing weight , i was down to around in october of and i met my current boyfriend .
i come from a village that is basically in the middle of nowhere , and despite wanting to be in a band since i was in high school , there was hardly anyone who was in to the same thing as me which made it a bit difficult to follow through with it . eventually i got older and started going to shows , and finally started meeting people who were in to the same thing . eventually i started putting on shows with a few friends . probably because i still did n't know anyone who wanted to be in a band with me , and putting on diy shows seemed like the next best thing to being in a band . now i play in a band , and the people i met through putting on shows were the first people to help out , and return the favor for my band . these people i now consider to be friends . i mean , i 've got people hundreds of miles away that i consider to be friends , something i never thought would happen while i was in high school . i guess that 's the best thing about being involved in the diy punk community . it 's cool to go somewhere far away for home , and be welcomed with open arms .
lastly , probably one of the most important things i could say , is smile . i know it seems like such a simple task , but some days , even though they could be few and far between , are good . some days are nt quite so tough , or rather , parts of some days are nt as tough . smile during those times . though it may not seem like it , you are so awesome . you re facing a level of pain that few people can even imagine , and best of all , you re getting through it . you re not letting it tear you down . yes , lots of days are hard , but you re fighting . that counts . rather than sitting on the floor feeling sad that you ca nt do things as well as other kids , you re standing there trying to figure out how you can do it in your own way . it may not be perfect , but guess what it does nt have to be . all that matters is that you re walking through the fire that s your life , but instead of standing around and letting the flames consume you , you re running straight into the flames and that , my friend , is so freaking awesome
it was a great day spent with great family . i thought i would experience this huge wave of emotions being my first mother s day but i really did nt . i absolutely love being carter s mom , but i experience that every single day that i breathe , not just today . my role as a mother changed who i am , but i m sure that s normal for most mothers . i feel like the person i was before was just preparation for my role as a mother . i do nt remember what it was like to not have so much love for someone so small and helpless . yes , there are bad days . days where carter makes me want to pull my hair out . days where i wonder whether or not i want a second child . days where i miss it being just me and justin . but no matter how bad a day gets , it never fails that the second my head hits the pillow at night , i thank god for that precious baby boy . he is my world . i just ordered a canvas that i m obsessed with , but i do nt have a picture . i ll have to take one once i hang it . but it sums up my relationship with carter pretty easily
martin came to my show every single wednesday when he was in town . i believe he was flying the new york route regularly from somewhere to ny . we were young then and i think martin was around years old . if i can be so bold , i also think martin was maybe gay , but perhaps not out at the time . if he was nt , my apologies . when i say such a thing , it only means that you are extra special in my eyes . all i know , in truth , is that martin loved my show and that i loved him back . i mean he beamed when he was at my show . he was such a warm and loving person and just about the best audience member you could ever meet . i do nt mean to speak of martin , as if he were dead . i do nt believe he is , since he should be a bit younger than me right now . i m speaking of him in the past tense because we have lost touch with each other , but i have not forgotten him . here s the thing you need to know about martin , he made my show better . just by being there , he made it better . when you sit in an audience , some people do so passively , but martin never did . he was fully present and alive during my show . i noticed it and i appreciate it to this day .
i remember worrying about what to do with the whole santa thing a couple years back . i remember not wanting to yank it out of christmas traditions completely but wanting to focus this holiday mostly on christ . i guess i felt like lots of kids these days expect huge presents or tons of little ones and are disappointed when they do n't get what they want . i remember thinking , i do n't want my kids to be like that , to be entitled as we the future generations are starting to be . i did n't want them to care about all the gifts that they get so much as they care about what this holiday is about . of course all kids are excited to get presents on christmas morning but i want them to know that it 's okay if it 's nothing fancy or huge whether or not we can afford a big christmas or not it 's okay to keep christmas simple and still get fun , exciting presents because christmas is about , as she put it her self a real person , jesus . i was also thinking about how some people play up the whole santa thing so much and try to have their kids believe in him for as long as possible and that 's fine , i do n't think it 's a bad thing but i do feel bad for the kids that some day they will be totally disappointing that he is not real . i think e will be okay with it and she wo n't be devastated , especially after that little conversation i heard , and that 's good , i 'm glad it wo n't rip her heart out
i started running a little over a year ago . my original goal was just to run a k distance . miles without stopping . i have walked many of ks in my life , but i could hardly run to the end of my block without going into heart failure this was a huge goal for me . i started with the c k program . but man , once i got to where i was supposed to run minutes and then minutes , i thought i was never going to be able to do this . my k race day came , and i could nt do it . i could nt even run minutes straight without having to stop . i ended up walking most of that race . i completed it faster than my previous ks , but i did nt reach my goal of running the entire thing . then it was time to train for my next race . see jane run marathon was in june . realizing that i was not going to be able to run that entire race , i decided i needed a training plan . that is where i ran into the run minute walk training plan . i loved it . as a matter of fact , i have loved it so much , it has almost become a crutch . i began to feel like i would never be able to run more than minutes at a time . so in the last year , i have tested myself several times to prove to myself i can run a full mile . i can run more than minutes . i can do this . i can do that . but i have yet to run a full k distance without stopping
